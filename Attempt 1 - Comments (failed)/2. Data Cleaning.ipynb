It's true he's not an engaging speaker in the same way as a Jobs or Branson or Mark Cuban or many other CEO's, but when you understand this as a symptom/characteristic of Aspy-spectrum people you can see that Elon is an innovator/engineer rather than a salesman/influencer like those other people. \\n\\nHe doesn't have the charisma but he has the vision and the drive to get things done.  For one I think it's refreshing to have someone with less of a filter, more mission-focused rather than image-focused.  Some times it bites him in the ass when he tweets without having things checked over by a corporate pr person, but you know you at least are getting what appears to be unfiltered honest Elon.</td>\n",

       "1272  To get specific - he said one comment that was sort of interesting... either shrink the base chain, or expand it.\\n\\nThis is where a lack of history with BTC comes into play **no one** really wants to expand the base chain, period.\\n\\nThe whole idea is to do 'second layer' transactions, and also **expanding** the base chain is one of the things requiring a hard fork (shrinking it does not).\\n\\nSo by default - expanding the base chain and DOING LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO - are equally impossible with Bitcoin. It is not meant to be done.\\n\\nIt was done purely as a stop-gap measure, while technology improved (and frankly I think Lightning + 'services' 'paypal, robin hood, cash app' - are expanding sufficiently that chain will never be expanded again).\\n\\nSo YES we would LOVE to shrink the BTC block chain! It **won't be necessary**, due to his other comment on how 'dial up' was common when BTC began, and adding 50 GB / yr to the blockchain likely won't prove detrimental... BUT...  \n",

I also think the Asperger's plays into this a lot.  Many people find him awkward and cringey when he speaks in long form unscripted conversations.  It's true he's not an engaging speaker in the same way as a Jobs or Branson or Mark Cuban or many other CEO's, but when you understand this as a symptom/characteristic of Aspy-spectrum people you can see that Elon is an innovator/engineer rather than a salesman/influencer like those other people. \\n\\nHe doesn't have the charisma but he has the vision and the drive to get things done.  For one I think it's refreshing to have someone with less of a filter, more mission-focused rather than image-focused.  Some times it bites him in the ass when he tweets without having things checked over by a corporate pr person, but you know you at least are getting what appears to be unfiltered honest Elon.  "

      " 'Nuclear Weapon tests are a more plausible cause of climate change than industrial carbon emissions.\\r\\n\\nThe detonation of a nuclear weapon creates a fireball that is many degrees hotter than the sun - this causes the breakdown of ozone molecules. The explosion then creates neutrons that strike the atmosphere causing massive amounts of nitrogen-14 to transform into carbon-14 with a modest half-life of 5,730 years.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAfter being created in the upper atmosphere, most of the carbon-14 then forms into 14-CarbonMonoxide and 14-CarbonDioxide which diffuse throughout the atmosphere both of which have exceptional thermal capacities. The remaining various radioactive byproducts then react with other atmospheric gases causing further damage to the ozone. With the lack of ozone cosmic radiation then converts more nitrogen-14 into carbon-14 through the same process. The constant nuclear detonations established a self-sustaining \"atmospheric fire\" causing continued release of carbon-14 since the 1960s even without the detonation of nuclear devices.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nIn the 1950s the first scientific research was published which suggested that the ozone layer was being depleted which led to the banning of nuclear testing in Antarctica in 1963. The ozone hole over Antarctica first appeared when nuclear testing peaked, it was originally thought that the ozone layer would recover within a few years after the cessation of nuclear testing however it still remains depleted today.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nBetween the United States and Russia, over 2,600 nuclear devices were detonated: each one releasing immeasurable amounts of carbon-14. The final nuclear test by the United States took place on September 23, 1992 and the final test by the Soviet Union occurred on October 24, 1990; however it would be relatively easy for the United States, Russia, or a another nation to resume nuclear testing and there is a real risk that additional detonations could rapidly intensify climate change.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAccording to SmarterChild the only practical way to clean the atmosphere in the short-term is probably reducing the amount of carbon-14 by converting some of it into carbon-13 with the use of high-powered lasers.'\n",

What? All that compute power in ETH which is magnitudes higher with all the other POW coins combined (let's not forget their respective market cap). If even a small percentage (2-5%) of ETH's compute power goes to let's say Raven, it will tank the profitability of Raven even if you factor in the up coming halvening.

My understanding is that as an ETF it would qualify for SPIC insurance. So if the brokerage went under you'd be covered. Unlike keeping your ETH in an exchange, where you're screwed if the exchange goes under. Yes, yes I know, you can keep it on your own hard wallet.  \n",

I have been following the development for years now. I welcome possibility of me missing something. Please enlighten me.  BBT here also claims that there are other coins to mine after the merge. What? All that compute power in ETH which is magnitudes higher with all the other POW coins combined (let's not forget their respective market cap). If even a small percentage (2-5%) of ETH's compute power goes to let's say Raven, it will tank the profitability of Raven even if you factor in the up coming halvening. This is very similar to BBT's claim on the 6900XT doing 2 miner instances when AMD's SAM is activated on an x570 board. They are all not true.  \n",

Or get paid through work on the blockchain. There is plenty of work for people, like ux testing as a customer and such (so, not necessarily development). It's not much, generally, but it's a good start when prices go up afterwards or when you then use such token in yield farming and more risky investments with good research about the starting projects.  \n",

Simultaneously GPU supply is improving and so prices are coming down which means whatever you're mining has to be more than the value your cards are losing per unit time in order for it to make sense. I would argue that if you have anything other than 3080s now is the time to sell them, especially if you cannot hit ROI before December at current rates.  \n",

Eth 2 will have many fixes (pos, base fee, sharding) or some layer 2 solution could fix it as well. But there is a negative effect of buying and holding Eth for users which could negatively impact Eth adoption if not fixed. I'm curious to see what the final plan for sharding looks like because horizontal scaling is the most likely solution. But I can see that comes with security or performance risks.  \n",

And it wouldn't have been a democratic power. It would have required to overcome more than a few senators with a few armed soldiers.

It will not lower gas fees but it will, hopefully, make it more predictable since the base fee is determined by the prior block's size rather than user bidding.  However, there is the added wrinkle of the tip with 1559.

I agree, there is no working product. With the arrival of smart contracts it should be a bit better than ETH 1.0 but still not good enough.

His point is that there is not any demand for large blocks, which is why the network is constrained. The parameters could be adjusted to reach about 300-1000 TPS without sacrificing anything. The parameters should satisfy the network until Ouroboros Hydra becomes integrated into the protocol. If there is larger demand than expected, IOHK could look into even larger blocks to lower congestion and therefore lower fees.  \n",

       "9963  IOHK could easily change the parameters of the network to achieve a couple hundred to a thousand TPS if needed without sacrificing validatortake pool distribution. Hydra is expected to be released in beta version this year with the finalized version coming in 2022, roughly the same time as ETH 2.0 would be finished.   IOHK is an incredibly competent and organized team made up of brilliant academics. I am very appalled for example on why Ethereum devs are working on EIP 1559 when they still need to transition to PoS. Ethereum is a much more anarchic project which is precisely why Gavin Woods left to found Polkadot. Vitalik has been wanting to move to PoS since 2014. Ethereum had many, many, many years to develop a very scalable system and if they had, they would have been #1 in market cap and there would be none of these “Ethereum Killers”.  \n",

This could be a great temporary solution before Ethereum sharding becomes implemented and rollups become widespread, which would be until 2022. The miners can handle bigger blocks and this will scale Ethereum well enough until later.  \n",
