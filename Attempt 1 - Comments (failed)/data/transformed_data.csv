Bitcoin1776,t3_oowqar,t1_h61vf8h,0,11,"To get specific - he said one comment that was sort of interesting... either shrink the base chain, or expand it.  This is where a lack of history with BTC comes into play **no one** really wants to expand the base chain, period.  The whole idea is to do 'second layer' transactions, and also **expanding** the base chain is one of the things requiring a hard fork (shrinking it does not).  So by default - expanding the base chain and DOING LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO - are equally impossible with Bitcoin. It is not meant to be done.  It was done purely as a stop-gap measure, while technology improved (and frankly I think Lightning + 'services' 'paypal, robin hood, cash app' - are expanding sufficiently that chain will never be expanded again).  So YES we would LOVE to shrink the BTC block chain! It **won't be necessary**, due to his other comment on how 'dial up' was common when BTC began, and adding 50 GB / yr to the blockchain likely won't prove detrimental... BUT if it were...  ""Shrinking"" is better than centralization - AND is the only option afforded Bitcoins, without a hard fork.  ---  If I was to be a whack a doodle commenting... I might say BTC could double block sizes every 5 years, maybe.. but it's a mute point. **He addressed this himself**, shrinking **would be** the correct direction. So it's mute...  To put it back to Tesla logic, once you get a car down to 1 part, do you go to 0 parts or 2 parts?.. or do you move on to other issues..  ---  Now he did bring up another issue about being 'money transmitters', which is a legal, non-technical, issue.. laws can be written to address this. And it's no different than running a node of a number of other type blockchains, and likewise calling them money transmitters, etc... so.  Anyways, I am glad Musk has more BTC than the other coins. It surprises me!  Overall I took the thing as quite apologetic, yet... apologizing in private, but cutting up in public, does not a mensch make.  So. Ya. He's a one-eye on him, sort of guy..  I'm fine with him 'doing his own thing' but the absurd slams are just... I would call it 'faux salesmanship' if he wasn't apparently losing a lot of money from it too (unless he's buying BTC behind the scenes... which is actually quite possible, then.. good on him).",to

If you don't like him i don't expect you to be persuaded otherwise by me.   Other people doing the same thing is not a fair justification for doing something harmful.

Joe has done these things publicly when experiancing backlash  With a public platform should come a responsibility to make sure what you put out there on it is either factually correct or presented as an opinion.  I only kind of agree with you here. He isnt a news site and has never marketed his show as one. He can only prepare so much because the conversations tend to lead all over the place and as an entertainer if a conversation is interesting he can't just shut it down and try and find another topic, conversations don't work like that and doing so would alter the atmosphere on his show. I agree it should be presented as opinion and my experiance from Joes shows is that he does speak in a manor that presents as his opinion a lot of the time. I am sure there are plenty of examples to the contrary too, no ones perfect and i have never felt it was for an agenda.   In many ways I think Joe Rogan is worse than someone like Tucker Carlson for the very reason that he is often honest, unbiased, and is not trying to push an agenda, at least with someone like Tucker you know what the game is.  Strongly disagree with this. Tucker Carlson is a manipulative ""journalist"". His show is marketed as a news show and he bends and cherry picks facts to his benefit. He is deliberately spreading misinformation. The poor fools that lap up his stories are no better than the poor fools that don't fact check the stuff Joe says.  At least Joe apologises for some of the things he says. I doubt Tucker Carlson has ever sincerely apologised for anything in his life.",you and i may look at his show like that but not everyone does you are right not everyone does but you cant make sure everyone fact checks things he says and it takes a lot of effort to speak in such a way that you make no mistakes when openly discussing important or sensitive topics if you dont like him i dont expect you to be persuaded otherwise by me other people doing the same thing is not a fair justification for doing something harmful its not that i am justifying what he has said just that we are all human and on a civilian level we make mistakes in our thought process all the time i have offended people at work when not meaning to or unwittingly approached a sensitive subject with someone it doesnt make me an asshole if i am wrong or i see it clearly bothers somebody then i back off make my justifications for how i feel or just outright apologise joe has done these things publicly when experiancing backlash with a public platform should come a responsibility to make sure what you put out there on it is either factually correct or presented as an opinion i only kind of agree with you here he isnt a news site and has never marketed his show as one he can only prepare so much because the conversations tend to lead all over the place and as an entertainer if a conversation is interesting he cant just shut it down and try and find another topic conversations dont work like that and doing so would alter the atmosphere on his show i agree it should be presented as opinion and my experiance from joes shows is that he does speak in a manor that presents as his opinion a lot of the time i am sure there are plenty of examples to the contrary too no ones perfect and i have never felt it was for an agenda in many ways i think joe rogan is worse than someone like tucker carlson for the very reason that he is often honest unbiased and is not trying to push an agenda at least with someone like tucker you know what the game is strongly disagree with this tucker carlson is a manipulative journalist his show is marketed as a news show and he bends and cherry picks facts

Similar to if I paid you using my Canadian credit card except in my case the credit card company does the conversion, in your case either you or your payment system provider would do it.

NOT because your business needs BTC.  However, maybe as part of your business plan you plan to keep a certain amount of capital in BTC, as an investment and/or hedge (or as Michael Saylor would say, as your claim to a piece of Digital Manhattan). While you could maintain this completely separately from the conversion process I mentioned, it would make sense to avoid unnecessary conversions and retain some portion of received BTC payments to fill out this part of your balance sheet.  As time goes on though, maybe paying your bills / salaries / rent using BTC instead of USD would become more of a thing.

itfwg,t3_oozcdb,t1_h61yq8t,0,9,"Even though you’re probably just trolling me, since you’ve expended enough time and energy to comment twice, I’ve added paragraphs here for you, to make the content more approachable. Enjoy:  Elon, the energy cost from bitcoin mining is proportional to its monetary value. Mining is a competition where each participant is incentivized to spend as much money on equipment and electricity as is profitable. This market will exist for any truly decentralized cryptocurrency.  Other cryptos cost less to mine right now because they are worth less, not because they provide more transactions per block. Bitcoin started with just one computer in 2008, using a CPU to process blocks. It could scale back down to that size one day if people stopped valuing it and discontinued mining.  The majority of energy used to mine is not spent on processing and recording transactions, it is spent on “rolling dice” for a chance to be the winner of each block and receive the associated transaction fees and block reward.  Elon, your affinity for other cryptos with increased block size and block time may be functional for some nodes who have access to gigabyte Ethernet and abundant hard drive space, but that’s not scalable globally right now. People in many countries cannot afford multiple terabyte hard drives to store the entire blockchain.  Currently, Bitcoin requires less than one Terabyte, and that’s after 10 years of use. The risk of such a change, to faster block times and larger block size, is that we could see a choke point emerge with cloud hosting becoming the only way to support and participate in a larger blockchain network, as is the case for E, which relies on Amazon Web Services running Infura.  E is not decentralized and will become increasingly political with a transition to proof of stake, if they are able to accomplish this. The point of bitcoin is to overcome human directed monetary systems that can be influenced by majority stakeholders, lobbyists, or law makers.  Bitcoin is a responsive system that scales up and down, seeking out stranded energy, providing a new way to use excess energy globally, and communicate value broadly. It is absolutely scarce, just like our time.

saltypinecone,t3_oozcdb,t1_h61xzt1,0,1,"Yes, there are some important factors I've glossed over, but I was only addressing the most fundamental factor that I see. Here are the others:  1. Fees. Bitcoin's mining revenue (and thus its eventual electricity use) is currently dominated by block rewards. As the block reward continues to halve every 4 years, fees will become a relatively more significant factor. Will fee revenue increase as well? As long as we hold to 1MB blocks, fee revenue will be proportional to the value the market places on on-chain transactions. Since we are shifting toward most transactions being on second layers like LN, I think on-chain fees will not get too high, but who knows. 2. Time value of capital equipment for mining. Miners currently spend a lot less on electricity than they make in gross revenue, something around 10% at the moment. This is likely due to significant capital costs that need to be recouped over a limited time period as hardware becomes obsolete relatively quickly. As mining chip technology plateaus in terms of hashes per joule, or as least improves much more slowly than the last decade has seen, equipment will last longer and miners will be willing to spend more of their revenue on electricity. Thus we can expect an upward trend in electricity use relative to Bitcoin's price (within 4-year periods) and to daily block rewards (over longer periods).",yes there are some important factors ive glossed over but i was only addressing the most fundamental factor that i see here are the others fees bitcoins mining revenue and thus its eventual electricity use is currently dominated by block rewards as the block reward continues to halve every years fees will become a relatively more significant factor will fee revenue increase as well as long as we hold to mb blocks fee revenue will be proportional to the value the market places on onchain transactions since we are shifting toward most transactions being on second layers like ln i think onchain fees will not get too high but who knows time value of capital equipment for mining miners currently spend a lot less on electricity than they make in gross revenue something around at the moment this is likely due to significant capital costs that need to be recouped over a limited time period as hardware becomes obsolete relatively quickly as mining chip technology plateaus in terms of hashes per joule or as least improves much more slowly than the last decade has seen equipment will last longer and miners will be willing to spend more of their revenue on electricity thus we can expect an upward trend in electricity use relative to bitcoins price within year periods and to daily block rewards over longer periods,"yes, there, are, some, important, factors, ve, glossed, over, but, was, only, addressing, the, most, fundamental, factor, that, see, here, are, the, others, fees, bitcoins, mining, revenue, and, thus, its, eventual, electricity, use, is, currently, dominated, by, block, rewards, as, the, block, reward, continues, to, halve, every, years, fees, will, become, relatively, more, significant, factor, will, fee, revenue, increase, as, well, as, long, as, we, hold, to, mb, blocks, fee, revenue, will, be, proportional, to, the, value, the, market, places, on, onchain, transactions, since, we, are, shifting, toward, most, transactions, being, on, second, layers, like, ln, think, onchain, fees, will, not, get, too, high, but, who, knows, time, value, of, capital, equipment, for, mining, miners, currently, spend, lot, less, on, electricity, than, they, make, in, gross, revenue, something, around, at, the, moment, this, is, likely, due, to, significant, capital, costs, that, need, to, be, recouped, over, limited, time, period, as, hardware, becomes, obsolete, relatively, quickly, as, mining, chip, technology, plateaus, in, terms, of, hashes, per, joule, or, as, least, improves, much, more, slowly, than, the, last, decade, has, seen, equipment, will, last, longer, and, miners, will, be, willing, to, spend, more, of, their, revenue, on, electricity, thus, we, can, expect, an, upward, trend, in, electricity, use, relative, to, bitcoins, price, within, year, periods, and, to, daily, block, rewards, over, longer, periods","yes, important, factors, glossed, addressing, fundamental, factor, fees, bitcoins, mining, revenue, eventual, electricity, use, currently, dominated, block, rewards, block, reward, continues, halve, years, fees, relatively, significant, factor, fee, revenue, increase, long, hold, mb, blocks, fee, revenue, proportional, value, market, places, onchain, transactions, shifting, transactions, second, layers, like, ln, think, onchain, fees, high, knows, time, value, capital, equipment, mining, miners, currently, spend, lot, electricity, gross, revenue, moment, likely, significant, capital, costs, need, recouped, limited, time, period, hardware, obsolete, relatively, quickly, mining, chip, technology, plateaus, terms, hashes, joule, improves, slowly, decade, seen, equipment, longer, miners, willing, spend, revenue, electricity, expect, upward, trend, electricity, use, relative, bitcoins, price, year, periods, daily, block, rewards, longer, periods","yes, important, factor, gloss, address, fundamental, factor, fee, bitcoin, mining, revenue, eventual, electricity, use, currently, dominate, block, reward, block, reward, continue, halve, year, fee, relatively, significant, factor, fee, revenue, increase, long, hold, mb, block, fee, revenue, proportional, value, market, place, onchain, transaction, shift, transaction, second, layer, like, ln, think, onchain, fee, high, know, time, value, capital, equipment, mining, miner, currently, spend, lot, electricity, gross, revenue, moment, likely, significant, capital, cost, need, recoup, limited, time, period, hardware, obsolete, relatively, quickly, mining, chip, technology, plateaus, term, hash, joule, improve, slowly, decade, see, equipment, long, miner, willing, spend, revenue, electricity, expect, upward, trend, electricity, use, relative, bitcoin, price, year, period, daily, block, reward, long, period",14,221,1371,0

In the long run, the amount of money spent per day on the ongoing resources needed for mining (for Bitcoin, that's primarily electricity; for Chia it's expendable SSDs) will trend towards the value of the increase in supply per day.  Yes, within a 4-year halving window, you can expect bitcoin mining's electricity use to correlate to the price of bitcoin, because the daily increase in supply is constant.  But you can't do that same simple comparison between different coins. Take a hypothetical altcoin (let's call it Pinecoin) that is similar to Bitcoin in every way, including current price, except its block reward is currently 3.125 units per block instead of Bitcoin's 6.25 units per block. We can expect Pinecoin miners as a whole to use only half as much electricity as Bitcoin miners do as a whole.  The interesting result of this is that Bitcoin will be like this hypothetical Pinecoin in a few years.

KashRiz,t3_ooj8au,t1_h61t531,0,3,"The benefit of cold storage is you are basically your own bank and control the funds fully. The negative of keeping it on an exchange is that your account can be hacked, coinbase technically just has an IOU to you (kinda like if u keep money in a Venmo or cashapp account), and coinbase itself can get hacked which would cause u to lose ur coins. Back in the early days of crypto many exchanges were hacked and all the customers had lost all their coins. Personally I believe the market has matured and something like coinbase (a publicly traded US company) is very very secure.   It really is a “to each their own” scenario. I have a friend who keeps 6 figs on coinbase for multiple years, and another friend who uses cold storage for .2 BTC. Many people on this sub will tell that holding your own keys is the only way to do it and if u keep it on exchanges you’re bound to lose it, but that simply isn’t true.

If Tesla is successful they will remove tens of millions of internal combustion engines from the world and completely remake how people think about transportation and car ownership.  Elon has always said the best car is no car at all.  That's revolutionary and will have a tremendous effect on net greenhouse emissions.    If Bitcoin is successful it will have similar world changing effects, but in theory it could do so while actually increasing net greenhouse emissions.  Bitcoin's mission is important, but it had nothing to do with Tesla's mission of decreasing greenhouse emissions.

With Sweden and lets say nordic countries... they have nearly completely nationalized healthcare and for that, they need to pay extremely high taxes. It provides ""free"" healthcare to everyone, but... if customers can decide between at first look free over paid, they will nearly always pcik free... private centers are going nearly bankrupt while state owned healtcare is exploding with people.   According to what i have read, people are suffering in the hospitals waiting for doctors even a few hours. Urgent is full all the time etc. Hospitals dont have any incentive to hire good and professional experts so they hire the ones with lowest salary.  As i have said and keep in mind that i dont live there and i have it from online sources, there is everything free but at the same time, everything is missing. If you chose private hospital or doctor and pay him, you have it nearly instant and with great standard. Why people dont do that? because they tax 70 % of their income (all taxes) so even if they wanted, its too much.  I completely agree with helping the ones in need, but it should be done differently than fucking up the whle industry. Lower taxes and let people pay for their needs. Let them have money for insurance, let them have responsibility but also the choice to pick where and how they want to be treated. I would say the nearly everyone is capable and should be allowed to do that. I hate socialist systems because they promote zero responsibility while reducing freedom. They can be done differently.   Take it all with grain of salt, i am as far from expert as one can be, logic and online sources are everything i have, so there is long road ahead of me... still, now, there is probably nobody who can convince me, that socialist systems dont produce shortages and surpluses, which are inefficient and in the long run, they lose compared to free market.

Help the poor ones in some different way, because nationalising industries just does not work.",i will read it thank you with sweden and lets say nordic countries they have nearly completely nationalized healthcare and for that they need to pay extremely high taxes it provides free healthcare to everyone but if customers can decide between at first look free over paid they will nearly always pcik free private centers are going nearly bankrupt while state owned healtcare is exploding with people according to what i have read people are suffering in the hospitals waiting for doctors even a few hours urgent is full all the time etc hospitals dont have any incentive to hire good and professional experts so they hire the ones with lowest salary as i have said and keep in mind that i dont live there and i have it from online sources there is everything free but at the same time everything is missing if you chose private hospital or doctor and pay him you have it nearly instant and with great standard why people dont do that because they tax of their income all taxes so even if they wanted its too much i completely agree with helping the ones in need but it should be done

The great thing about Joe Rogan and his podcast format is you can say what you want like you were just a couple of guys having a chat in a bar or strangers that met on a bus.  People may take shit he says seriously but that has always been the case. My parents used to say ""don't believe everything you see on tv"" and i am pretty sure my grandparents said the same to them.   Most of the time he doesnt know what he is going to talk about so he can't research it beforehand. He does get Jamie to do fact checking but by the time Jamie finds what they are talking about they have moved on to another topic. Should Jamie then bring them back and explain whats really happening or let the flow of conversation keep going.

It might have been a reason to SNEAK it around, but that's pretty damn hard to do with bitcoin since it's publicly trackable and all (see point 2)   You should only be using non KYC exchanges  Never heard of a non KYC exchange, except the ones that were banned for not being KYC that I cannot use because of that.   It would happen because Bitcoin undermines the whole traditional financial structure. Once 2 people use Bitcoin, they can do commerce without needing financial institutions  This is a more tinfoil-y theory of ""taking out vague competitors for vague reasons"" than your gold example, which was just about straight up solvency and (when combined with later raising of gold prices by definition like you mention) as a tax. It was about good solid concrete obvious Bookkeeping and revenue etc. not something like spycraft.

then okay but it isnt specific to guys who happened to have gold previously it was an instant money printing equivalent to the entire economy whenever they change the price under the standard you could have held gold you could have not held gold your savings were affected either way so even if they had news of this from a prophetic dream years earlier it wouldnt have been a reason to have

Expect more people to start “loading up” at some point in 2023, at the latest, in anticipation of this.

Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, nor next week. Statistically, it's less than four years from now. Anyone who bought Bitcoin at any point in the past and held it for 4+ years is in profit.   **Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least first year**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to.  Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO.  Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for SATs. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://amber.app/calculate-your-investment/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference.  Now, don't buy a fake Bitcoin at etoro, RH, PayPal or similar, get the real thing. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin.

FaceDeer,t3_ooai6l,t1_h5zopn7,0,1,"Maker would also collapse if ETH's value was to crater, too. Though less so than it would have back when ETH was the only collateral. The whole point of adding stablecoins like USDC was to mitigate the near-catastrophe Maker had back in March last year when a drop in ETH caused mass liquidations that couldn't be countered with ETH alone.   DAI should have a strict rule not to allow centralized assets as a collateral as it defeats the purpose it was created for in the first place.  Couple of problems with that. First, the purpose for which MakerDAO was created is to *maintain the peg of DAI to US dollars.* There's nothing in that that prohibits or requires any particular collateral types, MakerDAO's mandate is to go with whatever works to that end. Secondly, as this article says, MakerDAO is going to be fully decentralized now so the only ""strict rules"" left are the ones in the actual smart contract. It's up to MKR holders to decide what types of collateral to accept now. Decentralization means it's out of any particular group's control.   Better yet, it should've always stayed with only ETH as a single collateral, what's wrong with that.  We saw what was wrong with that back in March 2020, ETH's price suddenly dropped and there were mass liquidations. DAI nearly lost its peg.

DAI was supposed to eliminate that risk by being decentralized and not dependent on any centralized service, it reintroduced it with multicollateral DAI instead which is a shame.  **DAI should have a strict rule not to allow centralized assets as a collateral** as it defeats the purpose it was created for in the first place.

mooremo,t3_oo8uir,t1_h5xd5h0,0,1,"First, I'd rather that nobody manipulated the market. Saying at least it's Elon Musk and not the state doesn't make it good or excusable.    Second, that's not actually my point when I say he's bad for crypto. He has some pretty fundamental misunderstandings and he's clearly not putting in the time to learn more. Here are a few examples:  ""[Ideally, Doge speeds up block time 10X, increases block size 10X & drops fee 100X. Then it wins hands down.](https://twitter.com/elonmusktatus/1393738154889338884)"" There are so many problems with this.     Vitalik wrote an entire blog post in response to try and explain to Elon the problems with what he was proposing and Elon just replied with ""[He fears the... Doge](https://twitter.com/elonmusktatus/1396698902842122244)"". That's not productive at all and reflects the level of seriousness he's bringing to the table.    ""[BTC & ETH are pursuing a multilayer transaction system, but base layer transaction rate is slow & transaction cost is high. There is merit imo to Doge maximizing base layer transaction rate & minimizing transaction cost with exchanges acting as the de facto secondary layer.](https://twitter.com/elonmusktatus/1413396249546563586)"" I can't even...this misses so much about what L2s, DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts in general are. Again, this reflects on how much effort he's putting into learning about this space. He's not a knowledgeable participant in the conversation and he's not shown an interest in becoming one.     At present the only value he's bringing to the space is as an investor and he doesn't need, nor should he be given, a microphone for doing that.

Whether you're reluctant to switch to PoS or not (I'm excited personally, despite some concerns) the suddenness (by which I do NOT mean lack of warning, but the fact that it happens all at once) is adding insult to injury. Knowing there's only a few months left, why would most miners continue mining after significant and intentional profit reduction AND ongoing linear difficulty increase? There really isn't a good answer. The smart choice for Miners loyal to ETH would be to sell hardware NOW, buy ETH with the profit, and prepare for staking. The smart move for disloyal miners at that point would be to move to another coin and mine that before PoW ETH truly dies and there's a giant hash migration. Since mining is still necessary right up until the moment the beacon chain merges and PoS goes active on the mainnet, EIP 1559 kind of creates a liability for those few months (although also does some cool stuff for eth as well).

Bosphoramus,t3_omg95e,t1_h5v08xu,0,1,"Nuclear Weapon tests are a more plausible cause of climate change than industrial carbon emissions.  The detonation of a nuclear weapon creates a fireball that is many degrees hotter than the sun - this causes the breakdown of ozone molecules. The explosion then creates neutrons that strike the atmosphere causing massive amounts of nitrogen-14 to transform into carbon-14 with a modest half-life of 5,730 years.      After being created in the upper atmosphere, most of the carbon-14 then forms into 14-CarbonMonoxide and 14-CarbonDioxide which diffuse throughout the atmosphere both of which have exceptional thermal capacities. The remaining various radioactive byproducts then react with other atmospheric gases causing further damage to the ozone. With the lack of ozone cosmic radiation then converts more nitrogen-14 into carbon-14 through the same process. The constant nuclear detonations established a self-sustaining ""atmospheric fire"" causing continued release of carbon-14 since the 1960s even without the detonation of nuclear devices.      In the 1950s the first scientific research was published which suggested that the ozone layer was being depleted which led to the banning of nuclear testing in Antarctica in 1963. The ozone hole over Antarctica first appeared when nuclear testing peaked, it was originally thought that the ozone layer would recover within a few years after the cessation of nuclear testing however it still remains depleted today.      Between the United States and Russia, over 2,600 nuclear devices were detonated: each one releasing immeasurable amounts of carbon-14. The final nuclear test by the United States took place on September 23, 1992 and the final test by the Soviet Union occurred on October 24, 1990; however it would be relatively easy for the United

The process is secret and takes complete images in order to prevent ban evasion. * As part of the license terms, you're not allowed to say ""this image is illegal"", you have to quietly censor it. So it forces dishonesty by providers. * We're not allowed to possess or view this highly illegal data, so we can't actually verify whether it's actually illegal or we are being lied to. * ""Non photographic child abuse images"" (e.g. illegal artwork) are also flagged, and there's at least one case of an Australian being prosecuted for possession of a GIF depicting The Simpsons having an orgy. Distasteful, shocking, obscene art that isn't actually child abuse can detected and reported by the filters. * The effect of uploading every image to Microsoft's PhotoDNA service is they are also sent via American military intelligence (NSA). So classified photographs and documents can be hashed by the US and allied militaries and detected in real-time as they are shared on any platform on the web, as well as them passively getting a copy of every image of every person or document ever published. We'll never know how American military contracts have been won by industrial espionage that this enables, or how many scandals have been contained thanks to early warning systems here. * Because local ISPs in oppressive regimes also use the service to fingerprint and filter images, it's likely had a chilling effect on whistleblowing worldwide. We'll never know how much corruption went unchecked, how many journalistic sources were outed, how many real rapes and murders were covered up, or elections were stolen. But I bet it's nonzero. * Independent researchers can't create new novel ways to preemptively detect and block CP because the training sets are illegal and the metadata is secret, this must be done under special license by authorized people (Microsoft); innovation in this area is impossible.  You might think that these issues are a reasonable compromise given the alternative, but it's pretty uncharitable to dismiss people who disagree as paedos or cognitively rigid.

Cash Withdrawals If you have a bank card (carte bancaire) then you are able to withdraw money free of charge at any cash dispenser with the CB logo.  The ATMs are called distributeurs automatiques de billets (DAB)/guichet automatique.  There are limits on how much you can withdraw in any single occasion, or over 7/30 days, depending on your type of card and the limit set by your bank.  If you exceed your limit on your card, you can withdraw money from your bank, or from any other bank, by cheque.  You do not need your own cheque book to withdraw from your own bank, as they can prepare an omnibus cheque from within the branch that you merely need to sign.  If you have not exceeded your cash limit you can also withdraw cash from another bank by using your cash card at the counter. A charge may be payable and some form of identity will be required.  You will receive a receipt for the withdrawal, which you should retain until you have checked it against your bank statement.  Increasingly, local branches do not hold any cash behind the counter.  The only way to withdraw cash is from the cash dispenser.  If you do not have you card available then you will need to complete a withdrawal slip at the counter.  You will then be supplied with a card to enter into the cash dispenser to receive your cash.  You will not need to enter any code or amount as the card will be programmed to dispense your cash. The card will also be retained by the cash dispenser.  If you withdraw money from a cash dispenser using a French bank card within the Eurozone then no charges are payable.  Outside of the Eurozone withdrawing money from a cash dispenser does incur a currency exchange charge, which may be proportional and/or fixed (eg 2.5% + €3), depending on the terms of your contract.  In isolated rural areas, where cash dispensers may not be readily available, some banks have arrangements with local shops - butchers, bakers, tabacs, etc - that enable you to obtain a cash withdrawal through the shop.

Popper’s argument doesn’t just stop there lmao, and hate speech isn’t necessarily something that can just be countered with traditional speech. How about you copy and paste in the REST of Popper’s argument instead of being disingenuous and arguing in bad faith? This is from Open Society and Enemies, literally from the part RIGHT AFTER you ended your quote:  “In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise.   But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.”  How about that? Did you read that? Or did you just pick and choose your argument because you assumed I don’t read what I talk about?

He was arguing liberal democracies with strong institutions (like the law) can hold strong against and punish the intolerant that refuse to accept being called out. He DOES NOT claim an extra judicial censorship of speech, which is why I’ve been saying this whole time that social media should censor illegal speech. Hate speech, obscenity, confidential information, incitement of violence, fraud, IP-violating speech, etc. all aren’t protected speech by the way (depends on context but usually it’s not).

What does Twitter do, or not do, that people object to except moderate posts?  Or Reddit for that matter.  Moderation and Censorship are two words we use that essentially mean the same thing - except when we like the action taken we call it moderation and when we disagree we call it censorship.

Of course, Popper was not Yoda but how about not claiming to read things that you have not?

How do you have privacy at all with a decentralized social media with no content moderation?  Who said it wouldn't have content moderation?  Privacy is tricky insofar as your friends' servers might recieve your data if you have a private profile, and your friends might choose untrustworthy servers. I'm not sure how you'd have to design the network's privacy model to get around that, but I also generally think people need to stop pretending their social media are ever going to involve privacy.   Anyone’s information whether it be corporate secrets or personal info would no longer be private.  If you share any of those on social media, they never were private. Decentralization changes very little of that.   I think decentralized social media is a fantasy.

It's not decentralized governance of a centralized social network, it's a decentralized network. It's a network run on multiple servers by different moderators with different moderation policies. If you get banned from mastodon.social, you can move to... writing.exchange, or start your own node. Each node does its own moderation, and if your node doesn't moderate well, other nodes will defederate with you.  Nazis will always whine.

Then there are platforms like Noise that have barely any users despite giving out tons of bch every day to get people to use it.  Aside from the obvious issues like illegal content and scaring normies away with edgy content, there are less obvious problems such as bad actors wreaking all kinds of havoc that make a platform unusable (mainly spam) if they aren't aggressively banned. (And you can't address this by simply charging people to post without making it prohibitively expensive to use the site honestly).

I also spent time being locked up due to heroin (usingelling). So it can impact a life in the same way as far as the law goes. But even in prison CP ppl aren’t safe.

blackbread,t3_nrfu99,t1_h0ibrep,0,1,"Sorry for the late reply-- and I can only offer my perspective here, but this is what I think makes sense:  The cost of purchasing ETH is always fair, no matter what. If it rises to be $100,000 it's because that is what it is worth (in comparison to the USD). The thing that I don't think you're accounting for is that ETH is more or less a speculative asset right now (it's more of an investment than a true store of value). If ETH gets to be $100k, people will be purchasing it with more confidence than they are right now because it will have really started to approach its potential (based on speculation at first and then later by truly providing the value it strives to deliver). It will likely be that ETH is a lot more stable in another 15 years and the level of risk involved in purchasing it will be MUCH lower. So, if someone is purchasing today at $2k and another person is purchasing in 15 years at $100k, it is very fair because that person that bought today was taking on a lot more risk than the person in 2036.",sorry for the late reply and i can only offer my perspective here but this is what i think makes sense the cost of purchasing eth is always fair no matter what if it rises to be 100000 its because that is what it is worth in comparison to the usd the thing that i dont think youre accounting for is that eth is more or less a speculative asset right now its more of an investment than a true store of value if eth gets to be 100k people will be purchasing it with more confidence than they are right now because it will have really started to approach its potential based on speculation at first and then later by truly providing the value it strives to deliver it will likely be that eth is a lot more stable in another years and the level of risk involved in purchasing it will be much lower so if someone is purchasing today at 2k and another person is purchasing in years at 100k it is very fair because that person that bought today was taking on a lot more risk than the person in,"sorry, for, the, late, reply, and, can, only, offer, my, perspective, here, but, this, is, what, think, makes, sense, the, cost, of, purchasing, eth, is, always, fair, no, matter, what, if, it, rises, to, be, 100000, its, because, that, is, what, it, is, worth, in, comparison, to, the, usd, the, thing, that, do, nt, think, you, re, accounting, for, is, that, eth, is, more, or, less, speculative, asset, right, now, its, more, of, an, investment, than, true, store, of, value, if, eth, gets, to, be, 100k, people, will, be, purchasing, it, with, more, confidence, than, they, are, right, now, because, it, will, have, really, started, to, approach, its, potential, based, on, speculation, at, first, and, then, later, by, truly, providing, the, value, it, strives, to, deliver, it, will, likely, be, that, eth, is, lot, more, stable, in, another, years, and, the, level, of, risk, involved, in, purchasing, it, will, be, much, lower, so, if, someone, is, purchasing, today, at, 2k, and, another, person, is, purchasing, in, years, at, 100k, it, is, very, fair, because, that, person, that, bought, today, was, taking, on, lot, more, risk, than, the, person, in","sorry, late, reply, offer, perspective, think, makes, sense, cost, purchasing, eth, fair, matter, rises, 100000, worth, comparison, usd, thing, think, accounting, eth, speculative, asset, right, investment, true, store, value, eth, gets, 100k, people, purchasing, confidence, right, started, approach, potential, based, speculation, later, truly, providing, value, strives, deliver, likely, eth, lot, stable, years, level, risk, involved, purchasing, lower, purchasing, today, 2k, person, purchasing, years, 100k, fair, person, bought, today, taking, lot, risk, person","sorry, late, reply, offer, perspective, think, make, sense, cost, purchase, eth, fair, matter, rise, 100000, worth, comparison, usd, thing, think, account, eth, speculative, asset, right, investment, true, store, value, eth, get, 100k, people, purchase, confidence, right, start, approach, potential, base, speculation, later, truly, provide, value, strive, deliver, likely, eth, lot, stable, year, level, risk, involve, purchase, low, purchase, today, 2k, person, purchase, year, 100k, fair, person, buy, today, take, lot, risk, person",7,189,1027,1

Nodes aren't authorities in the network because nodes have no trust in each other. You have to have trust in staking nodes or miners in a network because they have authority in the network and can misuse said trust. With no trust there's no threat for a normal node so you can host as many as you want.  Nodes make the ""roads"" in the network. The miners simply distribute the Tx over those roads. The paths of the roads dynamically reconfigure as nodes join and leave the network. When miners are split on a fork decision, the nodes pick a side and the paths redraw to exclude nodes running a now incompatible protocol. You can go out of your way to stick with the losing side but most rational actors on the network will side with the winning side unless they have some strong opinion about the decision.  At the end of the day if the miners are tied, the ""true"" chain ends up being the one that more users side with and more likely than not the winner will end up siphoning hash power from the losing side as a result.  ---  In other words: If the government has a civil war, the winner is often decided by who has more of their citizens fight.

Yes, and many of those dApps were already up and running before they had a subgraph created on The Graph... I think you have your timelines mixed up. You're also changing the goal posts here...

From [https://braiins.com/blog/bitcoin-nodes-vs-miners-demystified:](https://braiins.com/blog/bitcoin-nodes-vs-miners-demystified:)  Unlike mining, running a bitcoin node is not very costly (it’s typically in the $150-400 range). However, nodes are equally if not more important than miners in achieving decentralization. The roles of nodes are to:   Validate transactions   Keep a historic record of transactions   **Dictate and enforce the rules of the network.**      In simple terms, nodes ensure that everybody — from miners to users and other nodes — plays by the rules. This can be done out of self-interest. Each user, wallet, company, mining pool, and exchange that runs a node is doing so in part to ensure they are not being cheated. Everyone running a node carries a copy of the blockchain and is responsible for maintaining and updating their copy.    As transactions are propagated and confirmed, node operators are validating that these transactions meet the rules of the network. If a user receives a transaction that creates 1,000,000 bitcoin out of thin air, the user (and all other nodes on the network) will reject the transaction. If any invalid transaction somehow makes it into a block, all the nodes will reject the entire block and wait for another to be mined which doesn’t contain any invalid transactions.   Bitcoin is based on consensus. **All nodes are in agreement to the rules of the network and the state of the blockchain, and will ignore anybody who is misaligned.**   Nodes who support the upcoming Taproot upgrade ""voted"" by upgrading their Bitcoin core version. Their consensus would have overridden miners' votes had the latter decided to reject it.",youre confusing mining rigs and pools with nodes from,"you, re, confusing, mining, rigs, and, pools, with, nodes, from","confusing, mining, rigs, pools, nodes","confuse, mining, rig, pool, node",17,10,1739,1

So the argument you are trying to make is that there was no difference between pre- and post- The Graph with regard to ease of indexing Ethereum's chain data? Be real, it took dApps months-years to build their own indexes and was a huge time sink and waste of resources/manpower. The reason dApps were able to be built so quickly in 2019 and onward was because the chain data was indexed by The Graph and made it easier for developers to make subgraphs using The Graph's data.  Developers were certainly able to build their own indexes prior to The Graph, but the reason most have stopped and instead now use The Graph is because it was bulky, inconvenient, and a waste of resources to do it on their own.  The Graph's usability and applicability was so powerful that even Solana, Avalanche, Matic *reached out* to The Graph and *requested* support. The Graph didn't ask these chains if they want to be indexed, the chains *sought out The Graph*.

DeviateFish_,t3_olla5w,t1_h5h9z8h,0,6," How could they have total control over the network? If majority of the nodes run the new software with the changes, then it's because the nodes decided on doing that.  Because they carry the inertia of the default choice.  Again: changes they want to put into the clients (and thus make the default implementation) cannot be opposed save for a supermajority of users *rejecting* that change by not upgrading (and turning off automatic upgrades, if they have them on)--or worse yet, are forced to coordinate a different fork that lacks the offending change.  Many people running a node are using it as a means to an end (using the network), and not because they particularly care in partaking in consensus or governance. Not all of them are actively choosing to accept the changes; they're simply picking the side of the fork most likely to win.  Forcing nodes to opt *into* governance by requiring them to take affirmative action *in support of* a new feature means that all users who do not have a preference are an implicit vote *against* said feature.  Forcing users to opt *out of* governance by requiring them to take affirmative action if they *do not want* a new feature means all users who do not have a preference are an implicit vote *in favor* of said feature.  It's worth noting that the opt-out approach incentivizes apathy towards governance. This creates a self-reinforcing system in which whomever controls the defaults has more or less total control over the network.  The more people who don't care, the more implicit votes there are in favor of the defaults.  The more votes there are in favor of the defaults, the less people care about governance, because having an opinion on the matter is decreasingly likely to have an actual impact on the outcome.  Remember: The most contention fork in Ethereum's history only managed a meager voter turnout of 5-15%.  That means up to 95% of the network had no opinion and would simply follow whatever was the default option.  To say that there was ""community consensus"" under these conditions is laughable.   But in addition to node choosing which software to run, does the difficulty bomb need to be diffused in order for the chain split to even work?  To some degree, yes.  This introduces a coordination game that's heavily rigged in the existing developers' favor, though.",how could they have total control over the network if majority of the nodes run the new software with the changes then its because the nodes decided on doing that because they carry the inertia of the default choice again changes they want to put into the clients and thus make the default implementation cannot be opposed save for a supermajority of users rejecting that change by not upgrading and turning off automatic upgrades if they have them onor worse yet are forced to coordinate a different fork that lacks the offending change many people running a node are using it as a means to an end using the network and not because they particularly care in partaking in consensus or governance not all of them are actively choosing to accept the changes theyre simply picking the side of the fork most likely to win forcing nodes to opt into governance by requiring them to take affirmative action in support of a new feature means that all users who do not have a preference are an implicit vote against said feature forcing users to opt out of governance by requiring them to take affirmative action if they do not want a new feature means all users who do not have a preference are an implicit vote in favor of said feature its worth noting that the optout approach incentivizes apathy towards governance this creates a selfreinforcing system in which whomever controls the defaults has more or less total control over the network the more people who dont care the more implicit votes there are in favor of the defaults the more votes there are in favor of the defaults the less people care about governance because having an opinion on the matter is decreasingly likely to have an actual impact on the outcome remember the most contention fork in ethereums history only managed a meager voter turnout of 15 that means up to of the network had no opinion and would simply follow whatever was the default option to say that there was community consensus under these conditions is laughable but in addition to node choosing which software to run does the difficulty

PeacockMamba,t3_ol7z7s,t1_h5d388w,0,28,"The Altair upgrade ups the ante on validator responsibilities.   Currently, fully inactive validators lose roughly 11.8% of their staked ether balance. After the upgrade, they’ll lose about 15.4%. In addition, validators who are slashed by the network for malicious behavior such as double-signing or double-proposing blocks will get fined 0.5 ETH after hard fork activation instead of 0.25 ETH.   The Altair upgrade also corrects a slight imbalance in the distribution of rewards. The vast majority of earnings for validators comes from votes and attestations of the correct block. Only 3% of overall rewards is earned from proposing the next block in the Eth 2.0 Beacon chain.   After Altair, block proposal rewards will jump up to about 12.5% of overall validator rewards so that the earnings for different validator responsibilities becomes more evenly split.

If there is a rapid drop in the price of a uniswap pair, if the volume of the pair is high enough it could be economically viable for an MEV arb to pay miners to go back several blocks to insert themselves into trades that are guaranteed to be profitable. Likely many bots can see the same opportunity and will bid against each other so most of the value here will go to the miners, which will encourage them to take up the offer. For example if there's a guaranteed $1M to be made on arbing a trade across a few blocks, it would make sense for the bot to pay miners $900K so they can pocket the other $100K. The average block reward is \~$4K or so right now so it is much much more lucrative for miners to roll back the chain rather than extend it. There just hasn't been a reliable public mechanism to propose those bounties, but at this point it looks to be only a matter of time. Then it's just up to the big pools to refuse to engage with those bounties, but if enough smaller pools do, and miners leave for those smaller pools, the big pools might shrug and join - just like they did with single block MEV.

Cheese_Viking,t3_ojnjs7,t1_h553fxd,0,4,"I think it is very likely that it will happen at block 12965000, especially since geth has already released a new version that implements the fork at that block. However the timing is a little bit more difficult to predict.   If the average blocktime until the 5th is at most 13.37 seconds, then the fork will be implemented on time for the bet. This seems very achievable considering that on average the blocktime has been around 13.2 seconds for the past months. Assuming that the average blocktime will stay the same, this would result in the fork happening around 17.30 on August the 4th.   The only complicating factor is the looming difficulty bomb. The bomb has the potential of exponentially increasing blocktimes every 100000 blocks. However, up to a certain point the effects of the bomb are cancelled out by the difficulty adjustment mechanism. If you look at prior occurrences, it seems like the bomb only starts slightly increasing blocktimes when it has increased the difficulty by \~5%.  The last difficulty increase by the bomb happened at block 12800000 (July 10). The difficulty increase was around 2% (formula: [https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/245#issuecomment-821329468](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/245#issuecomment-821329468)) , so it should have been cancelled out. If you look at the blocktimes chart that does appear to be the case (today looks like an outlier).  The bomb will only cause one more difficulty increase before the fork. This will happen at block 12900000 (July 25). Assuming that the hashrate stays similar this will result in a difficulty increase of around 4.2%. So this should also be cancelled out. However it is getting closer to the threshold, so assuming some inaccuracy in the calculations, it might cause a very small increase in average blocktimes, though probably not more than 0.1 seconds.  So it seems that it will likely happen before the 5th, however the prediction market odds are currently only 10% for it happening on time. Looks like a great bet",i think it is very likely that it will happen at block especially since geth has already released a new version that implements the fork at that block however the timing is a little bit more difficult to predict if the average blocktime until the th is at most 37 seconds then the fork will be implemented on time for the bet this seems very achievable considering that on average the blocktime has been around 2 seconds for the past months assuming that the average blocktime will stay the same this would result in the fork happening around 30 on august the th the only complicating factor is the looming difficulty bomb the bomb has the potential of exponentially increasing blocktimes every blocks however up to a certain point the effects of the bomb are cancelled out by the difficulty adjustment mechanism if you look at prior occurrences it seems like the bomb only starts slightly increasing blocktimes when it has increased the difficulty by 5 the last difficulty increase by the bomb happened at block july the difficulty increase was around formula,"think, it, is, very, likely, that, it, will, happen, at, block, especially, since, geth, has, already, released, new, version, that, implements, the, fork, at, that, block, however, the, timing, is, little, bit, more, difficult, to, predict, if, the, average, blocktime, until, the, th, is, at, most, 37, seconds, then, the, fork, will, be, implemented, on, time, for, the, bet, this, seems, very, achievable, considering, that, on, average, the, blocktime, has, been, around, seconds, for, the, past, months, assuming, that, the, average, blocktime, will, stay, the, same, this, would, result, in, the, fork, happening, around, 30, on, august, the, th, the, only, complicating, factor, is, the, looming, difficulty, bomb, the, bomb, has, the, potential, of, exponentially, increasing, blocktimes, every, blocks, however, up, to, certain, point, the, effects, of, the, bomb, are, cancelled, out, by, the, difficulty, adjustment, mechanism, if, you, look, at, prior, occurrences, it, seems, like, the, bomb, only, starts, slightly, increasing, blocktimes, when, it, has, increased, the, difficulty, by, the, last, difficulty, increase, by, the, bomb, happened, at, block, july, the, difficulty, increase, was, around, formula","think, likely, happen, block, especially, geth, released, new, version, implements, fork, block, timing, little, bit, difficult, predict, average, blocktime, th, 37, seconds, fork, implemented, time, bet, achievable, considering, average, blocktime, seconds, past, months, assuming, average, blocktime, stay, result, fork, happening, 30, august, th, complicating, factor, looming, difficulty, bomb, bomb, potential, exponentially, increasing, blocktimes, blocks, certain, point, effects, bomb, cancelled, difficulty, adjustment, mechanism, look, prior, occurrences, like, bomb, starts, slightly, increasing, blocktimes, increased, difficulty, difficulty, increase, bomb, happened, block, july, difficulty, increase, formula","think, likely, happen, block, especially, geth, release, new, version, implement, fork, block, timing, little, bit, difficult, predict, average, blocktime, th, 37, second, fork, implement, time, bet, achievable, consider, average, blocktime, second, past, month, assume, average, blocktime, stay, result, fork, happen, 30, august, th, complicate, factor, loom, difficulty, bomb, bomb, potential, exponentially, increase, blocktime, block, certain, point, effect, bomb, cancel, difficulty, adjustment, mechanism, look, prior, occurrence, like, bomb, start, slightly, increase, blocktime, increase, difficulty, difficulty, increase, bomb, happen, block, july, difficulty, increase, formula",23,177,2019,1

I have been following the development for years now. I welcome possibility of me missing something. Please enlighten me.  BBT here also claims that there are other coins to mine after the merge. What? All that compute power in ETH which is magnitudes higher with all the other POW coins combined (let's not forget their respective market cap).
