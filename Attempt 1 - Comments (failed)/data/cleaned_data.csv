I don't expect Joe has any particularly insightful view of Bicoin as far as I'm concerned. I know a billion times more about bitcoin than Joe Rogan does. Again, he's an entertaining interviewer that creates insightful  interviews by asking the right questions and being just smart enough and just real enough to ask the questions that people care about. He's good at that. He's open to hearing a lot of different viewpoints but also knows when people are bullshitting. Those are good skills. But they have tradeoffs, and they don't mean his opinion should be randomly trusted about anything he talks about. You shouldn't trust *anyone* with everything they talk about.    There is being open minded and then there is being so gullibly open minded that your brain falls out of your skull.  Some people are fine with believing whatever their teachers tell them in school, and whatever the goverenment tells them happens behind closed doors at the CIA, and whatever the TV tells them.

Dollar Cost Averaging is an investment strategy where you pick a dollar amount and invest it regardless of price periodically. Say $100 a month. Whether Bitcoin goes up or down you buy $100 a month no matter what. Over the long term you don't stress about volatility because when the price is up you're buying less, when the price is down you're buying more. If the amount your spending each month is small enough that you won't miss it too badly, you won't stress out over the volatility that comes with Bitcoin. Over a period of years, following this strategy could pay off amazingly, without trying to rely on perfectly timing the market, which is basically impossible anyway."

This is where a lack of history with BTC comes into play **no one** really wants to expand the base chain, period.  The whole idea is to do 'second layer' transactions, and also **expanding** the base chain is one of the things requiring a hard fork (shrinking it does not).  So by default - expanding the base chain and DOING LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO - are equally impossible with Bitcoin. It is not meant to be done.  It was done purely as a stop-gap measure, while technology improved (and frankly I think Lightning + 'services' 'paypal, robin hood, cash app' - are expanding sufficiently that chain will never be expanded again).  So YES we would LOVE to shrink the BTC block chain! It **won't be necessary**, due to his other comment on how 'dial up' was common when BTC began, and adding 50 GB / yr to the blockchain likely won't prove detrimental... BUT if it were...  ""Shrinking"" is better than centralization - AND is the only option afforded Bitcoins, without a hard fork.  ---  If I was to be a whack a doodle commenting... I might say BTC could double block sizes every 5 years, maybe.. but it's a mute point. **He addressed this himself**, shrinking **would be** the correct direction. So it's mute...  To put it back to Tesla logic, once you get a car down to 1 part, do you go to 0 parts or 2 parts?.. or do you move on to other issues..  ---  Now he did bring up another issue about being 'money transmitters', which is a legal, non-technical, issue.. laws can be written to address this. And it's no different than running a node of a number of other type blockchains, and likewise calling them money transmitters, etc... so.  Anyways, I am glad Musk has more BTC than the other coins. It surprises me!  Overall I took the thing as quite apologetic, yet... apologizing in private, but cutting up in public, does not a mensch make.  So. Ya. He's a one-eye on him, sort of guy..  I'm fine with him 'doing his own thing' but the absurd slams are just...

We just came off of an awfully slow descent to the support line, and while the b word conference was positive news, I'm pretty sure 99% of people who aren't in crypto don't care.    Let's not forget what the market looked like a month ago.  There was way more volatility, bigger green candles,  and we were all over the 30k to 40k trading range.  Then there was that pump up to 42k, which led to much disappointment.  We could be facing a similar scenario.  I will say that I have been confused lately by the lack of volatility and the lack of a solid bounce from sub 30k levels.  Yesterday was the longest time we stayed below 30k.  Sure, we've wicked lower than yesterday, but the lack of buying volume was a little odd.    It would be nice if we break the downtrend and go up from here, but I think we should be cautious"

You are right not everyone does but you can't make sure everyone fact checks things he says and it takes a lot of effort to speak in such a way that you make no mistakes when openly discussing important or sensitive topics. If you don't like him i don't expect you to be persuaded otherwise by me.   Other people doing the same thing is not a fair justification for doing something harmful.  It's not that i am justifying what he has said, just that we are all human and on a civilian level we make mistakes in our thought process all the time. I have offended people at work when not meaning to or unwittingly approached a sensitive subject with someone. It doesnt make me an asshole, if i am wrong or i see it clearly bothers somebody then i back off make my justifications for how i feel or just outright apologise. Joe has done these things publicly when experiancing backlash  With a public platform should come a responsibility to make sure what you put out there on it is either factually correct or presented as an opinion.  I only kind of agree with you here. He isnt a news site and has never marketed his show as one. He can only prepare so much because the conversations tend to lead all over the place and as an entertainer if a conversation is interesting he can't just shut it down and try and find another topic, conversations don't work like that and doing so would alter the atmosphere on his show. I agree it should be presented as opinion and my experiance from Joes shows is that he does speak in a manor that presents as his opinion a lot of the time. I am sure there are plenty of examples to the contrary too, no ones perfect and i have never felt it was for an agenda.   In many ways I think Joe Rogan is worse than someone like Tucker Carlson for the very reason that he is often honest, unbiased, and is not trying to push an agenda, at least with someone like Tucker you know what the game is.  Strongly disagree with this. Tucker Carlson is a manipulative ""journalist"". His show is marketed as a news show and he bends and cherry picks facts to his benefit. He is deliberately spreading misinformation. The poor fools that lap up his stories are no better than the poor fools that don't fact check the stuff Joe says.  At least Joe apologises for some of the things he says. I doubt Tucker Carlson has ever sincerely apologised for anything in his life."

Meaning you can accept payments in BTC but you'll just convert it to USD. Similar to if I paid you using my Canadian credit card except in my case the credit card company does the conversion, in your case either you or your payment system provider would do it.  I think today the main reasons to support BTC payments are as a value-add for the consumer and also because it can be cheaper overhead-wise than processing credit card payments. NOT because your business needs BTC.  However, maybe as part of your business plan you plan to keep a certain amount of capital in BTC, as an investment and/or hedge (or as Michael Saylor would say, as your claim to a piece of Digital Manhattan). While you could maintain this completely separately from the conversion process I mentioned, it would make sense to avoid unnecessary conversions and retain some portion of received BTC payments to fill out this part of your balance sheet.  As time goes on though, maybe paying your bills / salaries / rent using BTC instead of USD would become more of a thing. Also, maybe the various collateralized loan products out there would help make dealing with BTC more feasible (similar to how taking out a fiat bank loan may be a good way for a business to deal with cash flow variations)"

You could well be right that this business model is unsustainable but there has never been a company better positioned to make it work.

Enjoy:  Elon, the energy cost from bitcoin mining is proportional to its monetary value. Mining is a competition where each participant is incentivized to spend as much money on equipment and electricity as is profitable. This market will exist for any truly decentralized cryptocurrency.  Other cryptos cost less to mine right now because they are worth less, not because they provide more transactions per block. Bitcoin started with just one computer in 2008, using a CPU to process blocks. It could scale back down to that size one day if people stopped valuing it and discontinued mining.  The majority of energy used to mine is not spent on processing and recording transactions, it is spent on ‚Äúrolling dice‚Äù for a chance to be the winner of each block and receive the associated transaction fees and block reward.  Elon, your affinity for other cryptos with increased block size and block time may be functional for some nodes who have access to gigabyte Ethernet and abundant hard drive space, but that‚Äôs not scalable globally right now. People in many countries cannot afford multiple terabyte hard drives to store the entire blockchain.  Currently, Bitcoin requires less than one Terabyte, and that‚Äôs after 10 years of use. The risk of such a change, to faster block times and larger block size, is that we could see a choke point emerge with cloud hosting becoming the only way to support and participate in a larger blockchain network, as is the case for E, which relies on Amazon Web Services running Infura.  E is not decentralized and will become increasingly political with a transition to proof of stake, if they are able to accomplish this. The point of bitcoin is to overcome human directed monetary systems that can be influenced by majority stakeholders, lobbyists, or law makers.  Bitcoin is a responsive system that scales up and down, seeking out stranded energy, providing a new way to use excess energy globally, and communicate value broadly. It is absolutely scarce, just like our time. This is what makes it worth trading our time and energy for."

Here are the others:  1. Fees. Bitcoin's mining revenue (and thus its eventual electricity use) is currently dominated by block rewards. As the block reward continues to halve every 4 years, fees will become a relatively more significant factor. Will fee revenue increase as well? As long as we hold to 1MB blocks, fee revenue will be proportional to the value the market places on on-chain transactions. Since we are shifting toward most transactions being on second layers like LN, I think on-chain fees will not get too high, but who knows. 2. Time value of capital equipment for mining. Miners currently spend a lot less on electricity than they make in gross revenue, something around 10% at the moment. This is likely due to significant capital costs that need to be recouped over a limited time period as hardware becomes obsolete relatively quickly. As mining chip technology plateaus in terms of hashes per joule, or as least improves much more slowly than the last decade has seen, equipment will last longer and miners will be willing to spend more of their revenue on electricity. Thus we can expect an upward trend in electricity use relative to Bitcoin's price (within 4-year periods) and to daily block rewards (over longer periods)."

In the long run, the amount of money spent per day on the ongoing resources needed for mining (for Bitcoin, that's primarily electricity; for Chia it's expendable SSDs) will trend towards the value of the increase in supply per day.  Yes, within a 4-year halving window, you can expect bitcoin mining's electricity use to correlate to the price of bitcoin, because the daily increase in supply is constant.  But you can't do that same simple comparison between different coins. Take a hypothetical altcoin (let's call it Pinecoin) that is similar to Bitcoin in every way, including current price, except its block reward is currently 3.125 units per block instead of Bitcoin's 6.25 units per block. We can expect Pinecoin miners as a whole to use only half as much electricity as Bitcoin miners do as a whole.  The interesting result of this is that Bitcoin will be like this hypothetical Pinecoin in a few years.

The purchases occur regardless of the asset's price and at regular intervals.

Comparing building cars to mining cryptocurrency is asinine.  The two things are apples and oranges.    If Tesla is successful they will remove tens of millions of internal combustion engines from the world and completely remake how people think about transportation and car ownership.  Elon has always said the best car is no car at all.  That's revolutionary and will have a tremendous effect on net greenhouse emissions.    If Bitcoin is successful it will have similar world changing effects, but in theory it could do so while actually increasing net greenhouse emissions.  Bitcoin's mission is important, but it had nothing to do with Tesla's mission of decreasing greenhouse emissions.  If Elon's criticisms of Bitcoin help push more miners into renewable sources of energy that's a huge win.  Both things are important,and both things can be successful totally independent of one another.  It's absurd to think say : mining bitcoin is probably cleaner/better for the environment than building tesla's,  Totally unrelated and independent outcomes."

Well the answer is not much ‚Äì depending on the device using electricity it‚Äôs anywhere from 30% to as little as 5%. So, where does all that wasted energy go and what can we do about it? Or is it even worth trying? To address these questions, let‚Äôs look at where electricity is lost in the delivery chain.    Losses in generation, transmission, and distribution First, let‚Äôs consider the primary energy that enters the electric delivery system at the input to the generator and examine how much of the primary energy is delivered to the customer. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the answer is 34%. In other words, 66% of the primary energy used to create electricity is wasted by the time the electricity arrives at the customer meter.  Other sources claim that 17% of all power generated is wasted in the generation and transmission (with or without Bitcoin). Bitcoin uses one twentieth of one percent of all power:: 0.05 vs 17.0 percent.  Bitcoin's energy usage is not a problem - there is a lot of deception being pushed.

As i have said and keep in mind that i dont live there and i have it from online sources, there is everything free but at the same time, everything is missing. If you chose private hospital or doctor and pay him, you have it nearly instant and with great standard. Why people dont do that? because they tax 70 % of their income (all taxes) so even if they wanted, its too much.  I completely agree with helping the ones in need, but it should be done differently than fucking up the whle industry. Lower taxes and let people pay for their needs. Let them have money for insurance, let them have responsibility but also the choice to pick where and how they want to be treated. I would say the nearly everyone is capable and should be allowed to do that. I hate socialist systems because they promote zero responsibility while reducing freedom. They can be done differently.   Take it all with grain of salt, i am as far from expert as one can be, logic and online sources are everything i have, so there is long road ahead of me... still, now, there is probably nobody who can convince me, that socialist systems dont produce shortages and surpluses, which are inefficient and in the long run, they lose compared to free market. I dont see a reason why this should be different in healtcare. Help the poor ones in some different way, because nationalising industries just does not work."

The value of currency is based on the ""full faith and credit"" of the government.  In practice, this means the government will jail you if you don't pay your taxes in fiat. They can also shut down your business if you refuse to accept their currency. This backing is just as ""real"" as the promise of shiny metal. The dollar can only go to zero if the government collapses, in which case all your investments will go to zero.  There's nothing magical about gold. It has some intrinsic value for jewelry and electronics manufacture, but its value is based on the idea that people think it's valuable.  The same goes for Bitcoin, and there's nothing wrong with that. You could argue that Bitcoin is ""harder"" than gold, due to scarcity, security and decentralization. That's why I like it, but I still target only 10% of my portfolio in crypto.    I understand that fiat currencies always go to zero.  Based on what? What major currency has ever gone to zero absent war or an economic collapse?  If you really believe the dollar is going to zero, you should buy shovels and shotguns instead of Bitcoin. If the dollar fails, the electrical grid will go down shortly after.  The Fed is *definitely* printing too much money during the pandemic, but if the Fed has been ""failing for decades"", why is inflation just now ramping up? You do realize that before the Fed, there was a panic or depression every 10 years or so?  If you're worried about inflation (as I am), it should concern you that Bitcoin drops along with other assets when inflation is in the news. It seems like an imperfect hedge, but I think the situation will improve over time.

What makes anyone think their BTC is never going to move back into the ATH's again.

Well the answer is not much ‚Äì depending on the device using electricity it‚Äôs anywhere from 30% to as little as 5%. So, where does all that wasted energy go and what can we do about it? Or is it even worth trying? To address these questions, let‚Äôs look at where electricity is lost in the delivery chain.    Losses in generation, transmission, and distribution First, let‚Äôs consider the primary energy that enters the electric delivery system at the input to the generator and examine how much of the primary energy is delivered to the customer. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the answer is 34%. In other words, 66% of the primary energy used to create electricity is wasted by the time the electricity arrives at the customer meter.  Other sources claim that 17% of all power generated is wasted in the generation and transmission (with or without Bitcoin). Bitcoin uses one twentieth of one percent of all power:: 0.05 vs 17.0 percent.  Bitcoin's energy usage is not a problem - there is a lot of deception being pushed.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mvchzpbv2hE"

Other talk shows have a lot of airs and graces and you have to be careful what you say. The great thing about Joe Rogan and his podcast format is you can say what you want like you were just a couple of guys having a chat in a bar or strangers that met on a bus.  People may take shit he says seriously but that has always been the case. My parents used to say ""don't believe everything you see on tv"" and i am pretty sure my grandparents said the same to them.   Most of the time he doesnt know what he is going to talk about so he can't research it beforehand. He does get Jamie to do fact checking but by the time Jamie finds what they are talking about they have moved on to another topic. Should Jamie then bring them back and explain whats really happening or let the flow of conversation keep going.   Jamie will sometimes stop everything to correct them but i am sure it's a judgement call whenever he does.   I guess my point is you can't take something he says on the show as his permanent immovable stance on the matter. He's a curious guy and if we were improvising a conversation on the internet we would say a lot of dumb shit too."

If some nice old lady tells us god told her to feed and shelter elderly cats we ohh and ahh and think that‚Äôs nice and alright. If a serial killer claims god instructed him to kill a certain person, a person that might have been living in deep sin, we think that‚Äôs bullshit. That‚Äôs irrational. We would just be believing people regarding their claims to be in communication with god based on wether we agree with their actions or not. The problem with that is there are many instances in holy books where the deity acted in a surprising or unexpected way, that‚Äôs where the part of not understanding gods plan comes from after all."

They borrow BTC from one group, then turn around and lend it to the people dumb enough to want to short Bitcoin.  They charge the short sellers fees and interest.

They think that ""earning interest"" on their Bitcoins is a good idea, but it isn't.  They lend their Bitcoins to the middlemen and they take on various risks for a relatively small amount of reward.  You see, the long term average ROI for holding Bitcoin is about 100% per year.  One hundred percent per year.  That means, on average, long term, the value of held BTC doubles.  Double one dollar, ten times.  Answer: !1,000!&lt;      So, $5,000 invested in Bitcoin for about ten years should be about !$5 million, give or take.!&lt;  This fabulous rate of return requires no unnecessary risk.    So, there are dumb-dumbs who choose to risk losing their Bitcoins to try to get 105% instead of a ""measly"" 100%.    The relatively small reward is nowhere near being worth the risk.    The middlemen don't take (much) risk.  They pass it on to the ""dumb-dumbs"".  Whether the short seller wins or loses, the middlemen come out ahead.  So, don't believe people who tell you it's safe to short or that it's safe to lend Bitcoins -- chances are, they're shills for the middlemen or they're clueless stooges, repeating what they don't understand."

Have a look at the efficiency of the s9, s15, s17, s19.  The electricity cost isn‚Äôt the same from region to region and country to country. Mining somewhere in USA at 5cents of USD/kWh isn‚Äôt as difficult of mining in Germany with 36cents of EUR/kWh.  Then there is the procurement problem. Hobby miner are paying scalper price for new tech VS the industrial miner buying by the bulk. Or hobby miner will get a good deal on antiquated tech which lower the cost of entry but will push them off the network sooner.  At scale you also have the maintenance to pay for. Salary aren‚Äôt equal in western countries as in emerging countries or third world countries.   Every would be miner is dealt with another hand and someone in Germany could be operating a s9 at a loss, when someone in Greenland would be operating a 1000 s19 at incredible profit.  Also, difficulty follow price. You can‚Äôt correlate difficulty to halving event. Last halving saw a drop in difficulty to adjust for lack of profitability. If the price of bitcoin doesn‚Äôt double after a halving event, it could very well be that the difficulty drop by 50% as the less profitable miner will be pushed off the network."

More about this chart  Explanation  The difficulty is a measure of how difficult it is to mine a Bitcoin block, or in more technical terms, to find a hash below a given target. A high difficulty means that it will take more computing power to mine the same number of blocks, making the network more secure against attacks. The difficulty adjustment is directly related to the total estimated mining power estimated in the Total Hash Rate (TH) chart.  Notes  The difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks (every 2 weeks approximately) so that the average time between each block remains 10 minutes.  Methodology  The difficulty comes directly from the confirmed blocks data in the Bitcoin network."

When they raise the value of a dollar on the gold standard, it's a tax on everyone with dollars. If you choose to call taxes ""theft"" then okay, but it isn't specific to guys who happened to have gold previously, it was an instant money printing equivalent to the entire economy whenever they change the price under the standard. You could have held gold you could have not held gold, your savings were affected either way.   So even if they had news of this from a prophetic dream years earlier, it wouldn't have been a reason to have avoided holding gold in the 1920s earlier on.  It might have been a reason to SNEAK it around, but that's pretty damn hard to do with bitcoin since it's publicly trackable and all (see point 2)   You should only be using non KYC exchanges  Never heard of a non KYC exchange, except the ones that were banned for not being KYC that I cannot use because of that.   It would happen because Bitcoin undermines the whole traditional financial structure. Once 2 people use Bitcoin, they can do commerce without needing financial institutions  This is a more tinfoil-y theory of ""taking out vague competitors for vague reasons"" than your gold example, which was just about straight up solvency and (when combined with later raising of gold prices by definition like you mention) as a tax. It was about good solid concrete obvious Bookkeeping and revenue etc. not something like spycraft.  This would accomplish nothing like that, so it's pretty much a completely different theory that you need to argue coherently from scratch, not by pointing to hsitorical examples that... don't match it."

Bitcoin can not be attacked with a PC, or even a million PCs. The only spare ASIC miners are the ones which were recently removed from the network. Most of them have no home yet. They are owned by hundreds of thousands of people. No conspiracy is possible    The hash rate has since recovered to 100 Exahashec   worth noting that #11 Calculations in the original paper goes through the probability of a successful attack and how they could be implemented  That calculation assumes an attack which replaces one block at a time. An attacker can avoid the decreasing probability problem by shadow mining several blocks in secret in parallel with the regular mining network, and with more hash power    The 2020 Bitcoin Gold attack was implemented by renting hashes on the NiceHash hashing exchange. It cost about $1700 to rent enough hash power to overtake the regular miners for 2 hours. The attackers mined 2 hours of blocks in secret, and then replaced the regular miners' last 2 hours of blocks with their own. The attackers' double-spend profits were much greater than the cost of the attack    The other thing Satoshi didn't predict was that coin-to-coin exchanges would be an easy double-spend target    There are almost zero SHA256 hashes available to rent on NiceHash or similar markets. Do you know why?    Future risk: watch for the Bitcoin price to fall below $2000, and the hash rate to fall to 3 Exahashec. Then watch for the retired miners to list at least 4 Exahash of SHA256 on Nicehash    Even then, an attack needs a victim.

GrayScale are now a net seller of Bitocoin (2% fee) and their huge discount will put a constant pressure on spot markets. Big skeptic of a bull here."

If demand for GBTC shares is higher than the supply, the premium will go up, and additional BTC will be bought or sent for conversion to the fund (providing buy pressure on the spot market), if demand for GBTC shares is lower than supply, the premium will be negative, and people can arbitrage by buying GBTC and selling spot, providing selling pressure on the spot market).

Anyway, congrats on the move, it's never too late. ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.  Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, nor next week. Statistically, it's less than four years from now. Anyone who bought Bitcoin at any point in the past and held it for 4+ years is in profit.   **Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least first year**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to.  Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO.  Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for SATs. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://amber.app/calculate-your-investment/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference.  Now, don't buy a fake Bitcoin at etoro, RH, PayPal or similar, get the real thing. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin.

BCH currently has some smart contract availability although it's nowhere near as robust as something like ETH.  Honestly when it comes down to it, there's a lot of value to a widespread network so if crypto is able to function as a simple payment system for everyone on earth, but a complete payment system would only allow for 2% of all people, the former is likely to be the more valuable resource.  On the other hand, if a complete payment system manages to scale to global levels, that will obviously be the most valuable network.  This is why I have heavy bets on both sides of the smart contract / simple payment crypto divide.

Notably, a geographical L2 used by the shops of a given town would be a useful way to ensure minimal L1 commits: you don't need ultra high L1 security for your daily coffee transactions at the very same shops every time.   All you need is to be able to transact quickly and cheaply and, when you travel or once per week or month or the like, be quickly able to secure all the transactions you've done in order to join another L2 or even come back clean to the same L2.   This way, there is a very small pressure onto the L1, which ensures everything works fine, since any layer can only ensure so many transactions (which will grow with our tech to quickly transfer massive amounts of data between each others).   Besides, if we really have so many transactions that even L2 prove to be insufficient, it means some L2 are heavily used, which also seems to mean they could themselves have some L3.  Currently, many blockchains claim to have very small transaction fees. It doesn't mean they'd handle even as many transactions as the Ethereum network without having to charge as much of a fee. Most of the ones who accurately claim this are heavily centralized."

Though less so than it would have back when ETH was the only collateral. The whole point of adding stablecoins like USDC was to mitigate the near-catastrophe Maker had back in March last year when a drop in ETH caused mass liquidations that couldn't be countered with ETH alone.   DAI should have a strict rule not to allow centralized assets as a collateral as it defeats the purpose it was created for in the first place.  Couple of problems with that. First, the purpose for which MakerDAO was created is to *maintain the peg of DAI to US dollars.* There's nothing in that that prohibits or requires any particular collateral types, MakerDAO's mandate is to go with whatever works to that end. Secondly, as this article says, MakerDAO is going to be fully decentralized now so the only ""strict rules"" left are the ones in the actual smart contract. It's up to MKR holders to decide what types of collateral to accept now. Decentralization means it's out of any particular group's control.   Better yet, it should've always stayed with only ETH as a single collateral, what's wrong with that.  We saw what was wrong with that back in March 2020, ETH's price suddenly dropped and there were mass liquidations. DAI nearly lost its peg. The whole point of multi-collateral is to diversify DAI's backing so that it's not as strongly affected by fluctuations in the price of any particular one.  At the end of the day, results are what matters. If DAI's peg fails then MKR holders will lose their money, so that's why it's up to them to make these decisions to prevent that from happening."

If DAI can be destroyed by attacking USDC which is easy for governments to do then what's the point, you can just use USDC directly and have the same risk of that happening. DAI was supposed to eliminate that risk by being decentralized and not dependent on any centralized service, it reintroduced it with multicollateral DAI instead which is a shame.  **DAI should have a strict rule not to allow centralized assets as a collateral** as it defeats the purpose it was created for in the first place. Better yet, it should've always stayed with only ETH as a single collateral, what's wrong with that. Multicollateral DAI was a mistake and the reason I'm now reluctant to use it (I've been totally stoked about single collateral DAI)."

Saying at least it's Elon Musk and not the state doesn't make it good or excusable.    Second, that's not actually my point when I say he's bad for crypto. He has some pretty fundamental misunderstandings and he's clearly not putting in the time to learn more. Here are a few examples:  ""[Ideally, Doge speeds up block time 10X, increases block size 10X & drops fee 100X. Then it wins hands down.](https://twitter.com/elonmusktatus/1393738154889338884)"" There are so many problems with this.     Vitalik wrote an entire blog post in response to try and explain to Elon the problems with what he was proposing and Elon just replied with ""[He fears the... Doge](https://twitter.com/elonmusktatus/1396698902842122244)"". That's not productive at all and reflects the level of seriousness he's bringing to the table.    ""[BTC & ETH are pursuing a multilayer transaction system, but base layer transaction rate is slow & transaction cost is high. There is merit imo to Doge maximizing base layer transaction rate & minimizing transaction cost with exchanges acting as the de facto secondary layer.](https://twitter.com/elonmusktatus/1413396249546563586)"" I can't even...this misses so much about what L2s, DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts in general are. Again, this reflects on how much effort he's putting into learning about this space. He's not a knowledgeable participant in the conversation and he's not shown an interest in becoming one.     At present the only value he's bringing to the space is as an investor and he doesn't need, nor should he be given, a microphone for doing that.     If he demonstrates more than a ""LOL Dogecoin Memelord"" kind of attitude, I'm happy to change my opinion on this point; but for the moment I'm sticking to my original statement. **Elon Musk is bad for crypto.**"

The reasoning behind it is the risk that crypto takes over, their main fear is not decentralised crypto but more from companies like Facebook who would love to replace our cash to gather data about everything we buy. This over time could give Facebook more power then a county's bank. The other reason is that the un-banked would have easier access to electronic payments (not bad really). Also governments could pay benefits or collect tax with less middlemen (good and bad potential).

Merchant pays a fee around 0.5-1% to accept crypto through Flexa (credit card companies charge merchants around 3% fees). Flexa is also fraud proof. The 0.5-1% fee charged to the merchant by Flexa is then used to purchase their collateral token called AMP off of the open market at market price therfore driving the price of AMP up continuously as the Flexa Network gets used. The AMP that was purchased using the transaction fees is then distributed to stakers as reward for them staking their AMP. The AMP Token is a collateral token used by Flexa to allow instant crypto transactions at stores and online. Flexa is already accepted and in use at 41k+ stores.

Bitcoin is PoW forever. Yeah, they half rewards now and then, but the asic miners are solely racing against that halving. Whether you're reluctant to switch to PoS or not (I'm excited personally, despite some concerns) the suddenness (by which I do NOT mean lack of warning, but the fact that it happens all at once) is adding insult to injury. Knowing there's only a few months left, why would most miners continue mining after significant and intentional profit reduction AND ongoing linear difficulty increase? There really isn't a good answer. The smart choice for Miners loyal to ETH would be to sell hardware NOW, buy ETH with the profit, and prepare for staking. The smart move for disloyal miners at that point would be to move to another coin and mine that before PoW ETH truly dies and there's a giant hash migration. Since mining is still necessary right up until the moment the beacon chain merges and PoS goes active on the mainnet, EIP 1559 kind of creates a liability for those few months (although also does some cool stuff for eth as well). ETH 3368 as I understand is just trying to make that transition smoother. PoW still dies, but miners are less incentivized to just quit while they're ahead."

I might need to clarify, just for you.....  **Stories in Games are the Singleplayer and Coop Experiences that let you get to know the Universe you're in.**  You might be confused, because almost every AAA Game Studio has dropped Singleplayer, in favor of One-Mode Games that are Multiplayer only.     We plan on introducing our Layer 2 Blockchain, ERC-821 (where NFTs become Smart), ERC-1255 (ERC20 + ERC821), and a strategy to Commercialize the Blockchain.  We plan on taking over AAA Gaming by competing with Games that actually have their Creator's Heart poured into them.     The Visionary and CEO (me), will be making **LESS** than the Developers.  We will catch the AAA Studios off guard, and transform Gaming, by giving Players another option, and proving that Blockchain is better for Gaming, by making every item that drops in our Games, sNFTs.

It needs to overcome those issues while making the whole ecosystem more *dumb-friendly*.   If you do your own research about sharding, L2, ZK rollup, and so on you can see each of those improvements come with a respectable amount of problems driving down the usability of the system.  I'm not spreading FUD against Ethereum, I own myself a pretty good share of ETH. I'm just questioning if Ethereum will overcome all those problems in time, or if a competitor will take the upper ground.  That's not a question I can answer yet, but that's a fundamental point when asking yourself what is a good store of value. That's why I truly believe BTC as being a better store of value: it has literally no competitors in what it does: storing and retrieving values.    It serves no other purpose, I don't believe in the lightning network (I believe in wrapped-BTC) nor believe it will grow at the same pace as the whole ecosystem.  But on my risk scale, BTC remains way less risky than Ethereum.  This doesn't mean Ethereum market cap won't overcome Bitcoin value.

The explosion then creates neutrons that strike the atmosphere causing massive amounts of nitrogen-14 to transform into carbon-14 with a modest half-life of 5,730 years.      After being created in the upper atmosphere, most of the carbon-14 then forms into 14-CarbonMonoxide and 14-CarbonDioxide which diffuse throughout the atmosphere both of which have exceptional thermal capacities. The remaining various radioactive byproducts then react with other atmospheric gases causing further damage to the ozone. With the lack of ozone cosmic radiation then converts more nitrogen-14 into carbon-14 through the same process. The constant nuclear detonations established a self-sustaining ""atmospheric fire"" causing continued release of carbon-14 since the 1960s even without the detonation of nuclear devices.      In the 1950s the first scientific research was published which suggested that the ozone layer was being depleted which led to the banning of nuclear testing in Antarctica in 1963. The ozone hole over Antarctica first appeared when nuclear testing peaked, it was originally thought that the ozone layer would recover within a few years after the cessation of nuclear testing however it still remains depleted today.      Between the United States and Russia, over 2,600 nuclear devices were detonated: each one releasing immeasurable amounts of carbon-14. The final nuclear test by the United States took place on September 23, 1992 and the final test by the Soviet Union occurred on October 24, 1990; however it would be relatively easy for the United States, Russia, or a another nation to resume nuclear testing and there is a real risk that additional detonations could rapidly intensify climate change.      According to SmarterChild the only practical way to clean the atmosphere in the short-term is probably reducing the amount of carbon-14 by converting some of it into carbon-13 with the use of high-powered lasers."

What about the points about the actual implementation that it's led to?  * If you run or create any kind of platform that allows users to upload images and share them, then unless you send every image to Microsoft, then you risk getting your door kicked in and your servers seized. * If you use this service heavily then you must pay a license fee, essentially regulatory capture that levies a tax on every image sharing service and ISP, forcing them to be for-profit or sell user data. * We are not allowed to know how the images are fingerprinted, or to have a list of illegal fingerprints. The process is secret and takes complete images in order to prevent ban evasion. * As part of the license terms, you're not allowed to say ""this image is illegal"", you have to quietly censor it. So it forces dishonesty by providers. * We're not allowed to possess or view this highly illegal data, so we can't actually verify whether it's actually illegal or we are being lied to. * ""Non photographic child abuse images"" (e.g. illegal artwork) are also flagged, and there's at least one case of an Australian being prosecuted for possession of a GIF depicting The Simpsons having an orgy. Distasteful, shocking, obscene art that isn't actually child abuse can detected and reported by the filters. * The effect of uploading every image to Microsoft's PhotoDNA service is they are also sent via American military intelligence (NSA). So classified photographs and documents can be hashed by the US and allied militaries and detected in real-time as they are shared on any platform on the web, as well as them passively getting a copy of every image of every person or document ever published. We'll never know how American military contracts have been won by industrial espionage that this enables, or how many scandals have been contained thanks to early warning systems here. * Because local ISPs in oppressive regimes also use the service to fingerprint and filter images, it's likely had a chilling effect on whistleblowing worldwide. We'll never know how much corruption went unchecked, how many journalistic sources were outed, how many real rapes and murders were covered up, or elections were stolen. But I bet it's nonzero. * Independent researchers can't create new novel ways to preemptively detect and block CP because the training sets are illegal and the metadata is secret, this must be done under special license by authorized people (Microsoft); innovation in this area is impossible.  You might think that these issues are a reasonable compromise given the alternative, but it's pretty uncharitable to dismiss people who disagree as paedos or cognitively rigid. It's a real issue that has been weaponized by a multitude of parties, pretty much exactly how the like crazy libertarians and anarchists warned everyone that it would.

At launch, the protocol charge will default to 0, and the liquidity provider fee will be 0.30%. If the protocol charge is switched on, it will become 0.05% and the liquidity provider fee will be 0.25%.   This feature, including the exact percentage amounts, is hardcoded into the core contracts which remain decentralized and non-upgradable. It can be turned on, and directed by, a decentralized governance process deployed after the Uniswap V2 launch.

Cash Withdrawals If you have a bank card (carte bancaire) then you are able to withdraw money free of charge at any cash dispenser with the CB logo.  The ATMs are called distributeurs automatiques de billets (DAB)/guichet automatique.  There are limits on how much you can withdraw in any single occasion, or over 7/30 days, depending on your type of card and the limit set by your bank.  If you exceed your limit on your card, you can withdraw money from your bank, or from any other bank, by cheque.  You do not need your own cheque book to withdraw from your own bank, as they can prepare an omnibus cheque from within the branch that you merely need to sign.  If you have not exceeded your cash limit you can also withdraw cash from another bank by using your cash card at the counter. A charge may be payable and some form of identity will be required.  You will receive a receipt for the withdrawal, which you should retain until you have checked it against your bank statement.  Increasingly, local branches do not hold any cash behind the counter.  The only way to withdraw cash is from the cash dispenser.  If you do not have you card available then you will need to complete a withdrawal slip at the counter.  You will then be supplied with a card to enter into the cash dispenser to receive your cash.  You will not need to enter any code or amount as the card will be programmed to dispense your cash. The card will also be retained by the cash dispenser.  If you withdraw money from a cash dispenser using a French bank card within the Eurozone then no charges are payable.  Outside of the Eurozone withdrawing money from a cash dispenser does incur a currency exchange charge, which may be proportional and/or fixed (eg 2.5% + ‚Ç¨3), depending on the terms of your contract.  In isolated rural areas, where cash dispensers may not be readily available, some banks have arrangements with local shops - butchers, bakers, tabacs, etc - that enable you to obtain a cash withdrawal through the shop. The largest of these networks is with Credit Agricole, with the service called 'Point Vert'.  Since 2018 French retailers have also been formally authorised to offer 'cashback' in their shops"

Either way you are never going to be as effective as something that has the backing of an existing nation state or powerful private corporation. Given nation states are far more rationale ultimately than private corporations as they are not beholden to the profit motive they seem our best bet.

""de"" is a prefix that means ""not"" and ""centralization"" is ""the process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those regarding planning and decision-making, framing strategy and policies become concentrated within a particular group.""  Decentralization literally does mean that each individual or organization can decide how much they wish to collaborate or integrate with others.  So, yes, it means that within the new group people get to decide what goes on.  Consensus mechanisms exist to help those decentralized groups operate - when consensus breaks down the groups either have to work out their differences or split into smaller decentralized groups.  Now, we live in a world where power is exerted by groups to impose rules that they believe must be followed.  Sometimes, I agree with those rules.  For instance, I'd be happy to belong to a group that persecutes child predators and people who drive slow in the left lane.  That is a compromise of the ideals of letting people do what they want - but one that I am happy to live with.  However, it seems that you want to punish people who say things that you disagree with.  You specifically cite ""horrible alt right groups"" as the people that you want to persecute, so I have some assumptions about your political persuasion.  That's fine, you do you, but don't lecture me on ""decentralization"" when you don't seem to understand what it is."

Popper‚Äôs argument doesn‚Äôt just stop there lmao, and hate speech isn‚Äôt necessarily something that can just be countered with traditional speech. How about you copy and paste in the REST of Popper‚Äôs argument instead of being disingenuous and arguing in bad faith? This is from Open Society and Enemies, literally from the part RIGHT AFTER you ended your quote:  ‚ÄúIn this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise.   But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.‚Äù  How about that? Did you read that? Or did you just pick and choose your argument because you assumed I don‚Äôt read what I talk about? I understand Popper was discussing Plato‚Äôs defense of ‚Äúbenevolent despotism‚Äù, but he was disagreeing with it. He was arguing liberal democracies with strong institutions (like the law) can hold strong against and punish the intolerant that refuse to accept being called out. He DOES NOT claim an extra judicial censorship of speech, which is why I‚Äôve been saying this whole time that social media should censor illegal speech. Hate speech, obscenity, confidential information, incitement of violence, fraud, IP-violating speech, etc. all aren‚Äôt protected speech by the way (depends on context but usually it‚Äôs not). All I‚Äôm saying is within the American legal framework those types of speech are illegal and our society as a whole have decided they‚Äôre bad for the public, which is why they‚Äôre not protected.   Literally all of you types see the world as black and white, and fail to understand the need for nuance in anything, and the moment someone calls you out on it, you label that person as an authoritarian or whatever. That‚Äôs why the majority of the world disagrees with your political view, because no one overarching ideology can apply perfectly to any system."

It‚Äôs a philosophical argument that explains why hate speech needs to be excluded.  That is not what the paradox of tolerance says at all, which I hasten to add, Popper did not invent (he was discussing Plato's advocacy of an autocracy). I recommend that you actually read *The Open Society and Its Enemies* rather than just picking up what you saw on tumblr. You would have read him write, for example, ""I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, **suppression would certainly be most unwise.**"" (emphasis added because you obviously need it). Of course, Popper was not Yoda but how about not claiming to read things that you have not?  Also, consider that the society that claims to stamp out intolerance is itself intolerant and therefore unjust.  Before you read Popper, perhaps you should read J. S.

Aside from the obvious issues like illegal content and scaring normies away with edgy content, there are less obvious problems such as bad actors wreaking all kinds of havoc that make a platform unusable (mainly spam) if they aren't aggressively banned. (And you can't address this by simply charging people to post without making it prohibitively expensive to use the site honestly).  In the face of censorship by companies like Twitter and FB, it's understandable that the reaction would be calling for completely unregulated platforms, but that overly-simplistic approach doesn't work either.  What we really need is something like Reddit before Yishan was replaced by Pao, where they had a good balance of decentralization and centralization - the subreddit jannies could largely decide their own rules but you also had a (minimally) centralized admin branch of government dealing with dedicated bad actors like spam bots, illegal content, and the like.

Instantly labelling something a conspiracy is highly anti-intellectual because it dismisses evidence  and examination of facts and instead just automatically deems something untrue.  I'm not necessarily suggesting that the issues you listed are real conspiracies, but it's possible that some of them have some truths to them, while others don't. Again, it's about not immediately dismissing and labelling an idea and instead intellectually analyzing it to demolish it with better ideas. More discussion about it is encouraged to eventually arrive at the truth.  Another important factor that you're not taking into account is state propaganda and intentional disinformation in order to further a state's agenda. Manipulation is a real tactic, accepting everything as-is just because the government or the mainstream media says so is silly and naive. Would you accept everything the North Korean gov't/media says as de facto truths? No. You wouldn't. So then why accept anything your political party of choice or media outlets say?"

If it rises to be $100,000 it's because that is what it is worth (in comparison to the USD). The thing that I don't think you're accounting for is that ETH is more or less a speculative asset right now (it's more of an investment than a true store of value). If ETH gets to be $100k, people will be purchasing it with more confidence than they are right now because it will have really started to approach its potential (based on speculation at first and then later by truly providing the value it strives to deliver). It will likely be that ETH is a lot more stable in another 15 years and the level of risk involved in purchasing it will be MUCH lower. So, if someone is purchasing today at $2k and another person is purchasing in 15 years at $100k, it is very fair because that person that bought today was taking on a lot more risk than the person in 2036."

But in any of the ways I know, it's always either that the smart contract author didn't ask for enough gas or didn't send enough gas to at least one of the smart contracts it calls, for at least one possible branching (let's say, outcome) of the transaction execution. Some branching may be more complex than others and, as such, requiring more gas, which should be asked by the smart contract for the transaction to occur without error.

And even then, it's not a complete consensus but rather just drawing the lines between the two sides. It's also basic game theory that people will tend to the majority unless they have some strong driving opinion that pushes them against the current. At the end of all this you'll probably have two chains but the nodes themselves will probably be the deciding factor in which chain is the majority and which is the minority.

Nodes aren't authorities in the network because nodes have no trust in each other. You have to have trust in staking nodes or miners in a network because they have authority in the network and can misuse said trust. With no trust there's no threat for a normal node so you can host as many as you want.  Nodes make the ""roads"" in the network. The miners simply distribute the Tx over those roads. The paths of the roads dynamically reconfigure as nodes join and leave the network. When miners are split on a fork decision, the nodes pick a side and the paths redraw to exclude nodes running a now incompatible protocol. You can go out of your way to stick with the losing side but most rational actors on the network will side with the winning side unless they have some strong opinion about the decision.  At the end of the day if the miners are tied, the ""true"" chain ends up being the one that more users side with and more likely than not the winner will end up siphoning hash power from the losing side as a result.  ---  In other words: If the government has a civil war, the winner is often decided by who has more of their citizens fight. The miners play a major role but at the end of the day unless they have the support of the nodes/users their fork won't become the ""true"" chain."

From [https://braiins.com/blog/bitcoin-nodes-vs-miners-demystified:](https://braiins.com/blog/bitcoin-nodes-vs-miners-demystified:)  Unlike mining, running a bitcoin node is not very costly (it‚Äôs typically in the $150-400 range). However, nodes are equally if not more important than miners in achieving decentralization. The roles of nodes are to:   Validate transactions   Keep a historic record of transactions   **Dictate and enforce the rules of the network.**      In simple terms, nodes ensure that everybody ‚Äî from miners to users and other nodes ‚Äî plays by the rules. This can be done out of self-interest. Each user, wallet, company, mining pool, and exchange that runs a node is doing so in part to ensure they are not being cheated. Everyone running a node carries a copy of the blockchain and is responsible for maintaining and updating their copy.    As transactions are propagated and confirmed, node operators are validating that these transactions meet the rules of the network. If a user receives a transaction that creates 1,000,000 bitcoin out of thin air, the user (and all other nodes on the network) will reject the transaction. If any invalid transaction somehow makes it into a block, all the nodes will reject the entire block and wait for another to be mined which doesn‚Äôt contain any invalid transactions.   Bitcoin is based on consensus. **All nodes are in agreement to the rules of the network and the state of the blockchain, and will ignore anybody who is misaligned.**   Nodes who support the upcoming Taproot upgrade ""voted"" by upgrading their Bitcoin core version. Their consensus would have overridden miners' votes had the latter decided to reject it."

So the argument you are trying to make is that there was no difference between pre- and post- The Graph with regard to ease of indexing Ethereum's chain data? Be real, it took dApps months-years to build their own indexes and was a huge time sink and waste of resources/manpower. The reason dApps were able to be built so quickly in 2019 and onward was because the chain data was indexed by The Graph and made it easier for developers to make subgraphs using The Graph's data.  Developers were certainly able to build their own indexes prior to The Graph, but the reason most have stopped and instead now use The Graph is because it was bulky, inconvenient, and a waste of resources to do it on their own.  The Graph's usability and applicability was so powerful that even Solana, Avalanche, Matic *reached out* to The Graph and *requested* support. The Graph didn't ask these chains if they want to be indexed, the chains *sought out The Graph*.  I appreciate someone finally trying to give me a well-thought out argument, but it doesn't make a great case. It's really this simple: we didn't see many functioning or actively used dApps before The Graph was launched, and we saw tons of lending protocols and decentralized exchanges created after The Graph was launched."

The thing the difficulty bomb is good for though is to eliminate the unfair advantage of the ""do nothing"" choice. We saw this in bitcoin during the scaling debate, where the default option to not come to an agreement is simply to not come to an agreement and keep the status quo. The difficulty bomb makes it necessarry to make a concious decision about things, and keeping the status quo is not simply doing nothing but  a decision that fe requires a delay of the bomb.   The problem is probably less apparent with london since everyone agrees on the change and pools dont really have the option to not run it. They reason why I said that london is not in their interest is that they would lose a lot of revenue by transaction fees now that the base fee is burned. So the bomb is probably not enough of a warant on its own but it plays nice into things altogether.   The real possibility is the direct reason why the bomb exists, that miners will simply keep on mining on the old chain since they've got nothing to lose as soon as the switch to PoS happenes. They would have to make a concious decision to push their own version of geth with a disabled difficulty bomb and agree on the direction of this PoW fork."

For certain kinds of 51% attacks (particularly, reverting finalized blocks), there is a built-in ""slashing"" mechanism in the proof of stake consensus by which a large portion of the attacker's stake (and no one else's stake) can get automatically destroyed. For other, harder-to-detect attacks (notably, a 51% coalition censoring everyone else), the community can coordinate on a minority user-activated soft fork (UASF) in which the attacker's funds are once again largely destroyed (in Ethereum, this is done via the ""inactivity leak mechanism""). No explicit ""hard fork to delete coins"" is required; with the exception of the requirement to coordinate on the UASF to select a minority block, everything else is automated and simply following the execution of the protocol rules.  Hence, attacking the chain the first time will cost the attacker many millions of dollars, and the community will be back on their feet within days. Attacking the chain the second time will still cost the attacker many millions of dollars, as they would need to buy new coins to replace their old coins that were burned. And the third time will... cost even more millions of dollars. The game is very asymmetric, and not in the attacker's favor."

The properties of Ethereum are pretty simple.   Now, right-wing and hyper capitalistic are expressions that encompass huge bunches of meanings, some of them contradicting each others. So, it's pretty hard to disprove such unclear statement.   And I suspect it precisely was the goal: to make sure the statement is unclear enough so that it can't easily be debunked. Some people like to do that in order to avoid any valid counter-argument without having to think of an actual, solid claim.   Anyway, one thing is certain: the Ethereum community has proven its will to make sure people can interact in a peer-to-peer way, without trying to enforce rules at the expense of everyone else, and letting anyone willing to do differently do so.  This can be seen as hyper capitalistic in the sense of letting people trade between each others, which is the best we can take from all the meanings people out behind capitalism. And it is the opposite of any authoritarianism that some people put behind right-wing agendas."

If majority of the nodes run the new software with the changes, then it's because the nodes decided on doing that.  Because they carry the inertia of the default choice.  Again: changes they want to put into the clients (and thus make the default implementation) cannot be opposed save for a supermajority of users *rejecting* that change by not upgrading (and turning off automatic upgrades, if they have them on)--or worse yet, are forced to coordinate a different fork that lacks the offending change.  Many people running a node are using it as a means to an end (using the network), and not because they particularly care in partaking in consensus or governance. Not all of them are actively choosing to accept the changes; they're simply picking the side of the fork most likely to win.  Forcing nodes to opt *into* governance by requiring them to take affirmative action *in support of* a new feature means that all users who do not have a preference are an implicit vote *against* said feature.  Forcing users to opt *out of* governance by requiring them to take affirmative action if they *do not want* a new feature means all users who do not have a preference are an implicit vote *in favor* of said feature.  It's worth noting that the opt-out approach incentivizes apathy towards governance. This creates a self-reinforcing system in which whomever controls the defaults has more or less total control over the network.  The more people who don't care, the more implicit votes there are in favor of the defaults.  The more votes there are in favor of the defaults, the less people care about governance, because having an opinion on the matter is decreasingly likely to have an actual impact on the outcome.  Remember: The most contention fork in Ethereum's history only managed a meager voter turnout of 5-15%.  That means up to 95% of the network had no opinion and would simply follow whatever was the default option.  To say that there was ""community consensus"" under these conditions is laughable.   But in addition to node choosing which software to run, does the difficulty bomb need to be diffused in order for the chain split to even work?  To some degree, yes.  This introduces a coordination game that's heavily rigged in the existing developers' favor, though."

In a blockchain like Bitcoin's, any major improvement has to fight against the status quo of keeping the chain as-is which defaults as the path of least resistence for the majority.   With Ethereum, the status quo is to follow the new fork no matter what and to ""ditch"" the old fork.

Crypto I think goes further to gamify our economies, and this will be a good thing long term.  The important shift is that in these new games it's not wealthy individuals writing the rules, it's mathematicians, programmers, and communal consensus. So yes like any opportunity on earth the wealthy have a significant advantage, but over the long term I see the systems favoring equality assuming they are built to.   Cryptocurrency is also probably the only way we'll ever see a true global UBI.

Currently, fully inactive validators lose roughly 11.8% of their staked ether balance. After the upgrade, they‚Äôll lose about 15.4%. In addition, validators who are slashed by the network for malicious behavior such as double-signing or double-proposing blocks will get fined 0.5 ETH after hard fork activation instead of 0.25 ETH.   The Altair upgrade also corrects a slight imbalance in the distribution of rewards. The vast majority of earnings for validators comes from votes and attestations of the correct block. Only 3% of overall rewards is earned from proposing the next block in the Eth 2.0 Beacon chain.   After Altair, block proposal rewards will jump up to about 12.5% of overall validator rewards so that the earnings for different validator responsibilities becomes more evenly split.   Altair is considered a ‚Äúwarm-up upgrade‚Äù meant to prepare Eth 2.0 protocol developers for a much higher-stakes upgrade upcoming later this year or early next. This latter upgrade expected to follow Altair will permanently fuse the Ethereum blockchain with the Eth 2.0 Beacon Chain and fully transition Ethereum to a PoS protocol. "

If there is a rapid drop in the price of a uniswap pair, if the volume of the pair is high enough it could be economically viable for an MEV arb to pay miners to go back several blocks to insert themselves into trades that are guaranteed to be profitable. Likely many bots can see the same opportunity and will bid against each other so most of the value here will go to the miners, which will encourage them to take up the offer. For example if there's a guaranteed $1M to be made on arbing a trade across a few blocks, it would make sense for the bot to pay miners $900K so they can pocket the other $100K. The average block reward is \~$4K or so right now so it is much much more lucrative for miners to roll back the chain rather than extend it. There just hasn't been a reliable public mechanism to propose those bounties, but at this point it looks to be only a matter of time. Then it's just up to the big pools to refuse to engage with those bounties, but if enough smaller pools do, and miners leave for those smaller pools, the big pools might shrug and join - just like they did with single block MEV.   The traditional argument has always been that reorgs are so damaging to the chain that they will tank the price of ETH and miners don't want that, but the impending merge removes that constraint because they will have less and less left to lose as it comes closer. It's only a matter of time now."

It looks like these people want that juicy attention - that's why they came up with all these weird flashy names for the old issues.  Assuming you can create a contract that drops a bounty from the stolen funds for each reverted block, you again don't need to bother with any convoluted strategies. Just send ETH to the exchange, buy other coin, withdraw it, and then drop a bounty on the ETH deposit reversal. That's it. No effort required.  Although I'm not sure if such attack is game theoretically stable - there may be a betrayal strategy that will be more profitable to each colluding miner individually.

These problems were known since a long time, and most smart contracts are equipped with countermeasures (slippage limits ect.)   The second is a novel attack, called a time-bandit attack, that forks the blockchain retroactively based on past MEV  The security model is considered broken if any single entity have 51% of entire hashing power, so what are we even talking about???   This has been written by someone who doesn't understand very basic security assumptions of PoW based blockchain   ""Rental attacks"" are feasible using cloud resources, particularly for systems such as Ethereum that rely heavily on GPUs, which are standard cloud commodities. Sites such as http://crypto51.app/ estimate the costs.  If you could just rent 51% of hashing power, why would you engage in some stupidly complex MEV scheme??? You send ETH to the centralized exchange, purchase Monero or any other crypto) withdraw Monero to your address, rewind the ETH Blockchain. Rinse and repeat.  Also nobody managed to rent enough hashrate even to attack anything but smallest projects. I really doubt there's enough rentable hastate on the market to attack ETH"

The Ethereum blockchain is already so big that you need special hardware to host it. This leads to centralization, which leads to corruption.   Bitcoin fixes this.

In the one above, the miner will reject all txns below a certain tip threshold.  So that means some of the txn will have a tip, albeit below the minimum he would accept.  If he rejects them, he will indeed lose revenue and will likely not pursue this strategy.    I am talking about the case where the miners will reject all txns without a tip.  If enough miners do this, and it seems possible since they lose nothing, it will condition users to include a tip.  At that point, how is that diff than what we are doing today?  And if so, what is the purpose of 1559?  Where it the fee predictability within the block?"

However the timing is a little bit more difficult to predict.   If the average blocktime until the 5th is at most 13.37 seconds, then the fork will be implemented on time for the bet. This seems very achievable considering that on average the blocktime has been around 13.2 seconds for the past months. Assuming that the average blocktime will stay the same, this would result in the fork happening around 17.30 on August the 4th.   The only complicating factor is the looming difficulty bomb. The bomb has the potential of exponentially increasing blocktimes every 100000 blocks. However, up to a certain point the effects of the bomb are cancelled out by the difficulty adjustment mechanism. If you look at prior occurrences, it seems like the bomb only starts slightly increasing blocktimes when it has increased the difficulty by \~5%.  The last difficulty increase by the bomb happened at block 12800000 (July 10). The difficulty increase was around 2% (formula: [https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/245#issuecomment-821329468](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/245#issuecomment-821329468)) , so it should have been cancelled out. If you look at the blocktimes chart that does appear to be the case (today looks like an outlier).  The bomb will only cause one more difficulty increase before the fork. This will happen at block 12900000 (July 25). Assuming that the hashrate stays similar this will result in a difficulty increase of around 4.2%. So this should also be cancelled out. However it is getting closer to the threshold, so assuming some inaccuracy in the calculations, it might cause a very small increase in average blocktimes, though probably not more than 0.1 seconds.  So it seems that it will likely happen before the 5th, however the prediction market odds are currently only 10% for it happening on time. Looks like a great bet"

I agree, there is no working product. With the arrival of smart contracts it should be a bit better than ETH 1.0 but still not good enough. Solana has a working product, that can handle 100k TPS at the given moment."

His point is that there is not any demand for large blocks, which is why the network is constrained. The parameters could be adjusted to reach about 300-1000 TPS without sacrificing anything. The parameters should satisfy the network until Ouroboros Hydra becomes integrated into the protocol. If there is larger demand than expected, IOHK could look into even larger blocks to lower congestion and therefore lower fees."

With Hydra, it creates a completely second layer, fully interoperable and programmable. It would have a routing mechanism, smart contracts, etc. all in one layer.

Hydra is expected to be released in beta version this year with the finalized version coming in 2022, roughly the same time as ETH 2.0 would be finished.   IOHK is an incredibly competent and organized team made up of brilliant academics. I am very appalled for example on why Ethereum devs are working on EIP 1559 when they still need to transition to PoS. Ethereum is a much more anarchic project which is precisely why Gavin Woods left to found Polkadot. Vitalik has been wanting to move to PoS since 2014. Ethereum had many, many, many years to develop a very scalable system and if they had, they would have been #1 in market cap and there would be none of these ‚ÄúEthereum Killers‚Äù."

Ethereum could raise the gas limit substantially, which would in effect lower congestion which lowers fees, and have mining pools and large miners be able to store the blockchain and handle the demand.   This could be a great temporary solution before Ethereum sharding becomes implemented and rollups become widespread, which would be until 2022. The miners can handle bigger blocks and this will scale Ethereum well enough until later."
