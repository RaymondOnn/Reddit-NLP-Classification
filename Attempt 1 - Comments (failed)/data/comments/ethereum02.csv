&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin is PoW forever. Yeah, they half rewards now and then, but the asic miners are solely racing against that halving. Whether you're reluctant to switch to PoS or not (I'm excited personally, despite some concerns) the suddenness (by which I do NOT mean lack of warning, but the fact that it happens all at once) is adding insult to injury. Knowing there's only a few months left, why would most miners continue mining after significant and intentional profit reduction AND ongoing linear difficulty increase? There really isn't a good answer. The smart choice for Miners loyal to ETH would be to sell hardware NOW, buy ETH with the profit, and prepare for staking. The smart move for disloyal miners at that point would be to move to another coin and mine that before PoW ETH truly dies and there's a giant hash migration. Since mining is still necessary right up until the moment the beacon chain merges and PoS goes active on the mainnet, EIP 1559 kind of creates a liability for those few months (although also does some cool stuff for eth as well). ETH 3368 as I understand is just trying to make that transition smoother.

We're just a Game Studio trying to change the World by getting rid of Microtransactions, standing by our Game Developers, and bringing amazing Stories to the Gaming Community.    


We're getting rid of Microtransactions by banning their use in our Games, and our Blockchain.    


We're standing by our Developers by giving them a 65% Pay Bump, a 4 Day Work Week, and plenty of PTO, to ensure they aren't worked to death, like every other Game Studio.  


And we're bringing Amazing Stories to the Gaming Community, by literally letting you pick between 3 Amazing Stories, that are ready for Pre-Production.    


I might need to clarify, just for you.....  **Stories in Games are the Singleplayer and Coop Experiences that let you get to know the Universe you're in.**  You might be confused, because almost every AAA Game Studio has dropped Singleplayer, in favor of One-Mode Games that are Multiplayer only.  


We plan on introducing our Layer 2 Blockchain, ERC-821 (where NFTs become Smart), ERC-1255 (ERC20 + ERC821), and a strategy to Commercialize the Blockchain.  We plan on taking over AAA Gaming by competing with Games that actually have their Creator's Heart poured into them.    
The Visionary and CEO (me), will be making **LESS** than the Developers.  We will catch the AAA Studios off guard, and transform Gaming, by giving Players another option, and proving that Blockchain is better for Gaming, by making every item that drops in our Games, sNFTs.  


If you even looked at the Tokenomics, the Initial Team has 10% allocated, and only receives 10% of that, for 4 Years.  The Community (Gamers, Investors, Backers, etc) have 55% allocated.

I'll merit you with a real response:

You could just do a generic nudity/NSFW detection algorithm then apply facial age in order to flag images that are NSFW and underage. There are state of the art systems that are open source and very accurate.

You obviously do not need a database of illegal content to do this.

If somehow a false-negative passed through and the government insisted on charging you with a crime despite taking steps to filter that content then you probably need a new government.

I can understand where you're coming from if Australia's priorities are so out of place that they would waste resources on something that's obviously a parody.

Like actually investing money towards putting all pornographic content behind the .XXX tld and requiring search engines to filter out pornography all together so that a kid doesn't end up on xhamster after looking up ""hamster picture"" or some shit.  But who needs that, right?

If you do your own research about sharding, L2, ZK rollup, and so on you can see each of those improvements come with a respectable amount of problems driving down the usability of the system.

I'm not spreading FUD against Ethereum, I own myself a pretty good share of ETH. I'm just questioning if Ethereum will overcome all those problems in time, or if a competitor will take the upper ground.

That's not a question I can answer yet, but that's a fundamental point when asking yourself what is a good store of value. That's why I truly believe BTC as being a better store of value: it has literally no competitors in what it does: storing and retrieving values.   
It serves no other purpose, I don't believe in the lightning network (I believe in wrapped-BTC) nor believe it will grow at the same pace as the whole ecosystem.  But on my risk scale, BTC remains way less risky than Ethereum.

[],,Bosphoramus,,,,,,False,[],"Nuclear Weapon tests are a more plausible cause of climate change than industrial carbon emissions.

The detonation of a nuclear weapon creates a fireball that is many degrees hotter than the sun - this causes the breakdown of ozone molecules. The explosion then creates neutrons that strike the atmosphere causing massive amounts of nitrogen-14 to transform into carbon-14 with a modest half-life of 5,730 years.  
  
After being created in the upper atmosphere, most of the carbon-14 then forms into 14-CarbonMonoxide and 14-CarbonDioxide which diffuse throughout the atmosphere both of which have exceptional thermal capacities. The remaining various radioactive byproducts then react with other atmospheric gases causing further damage to the ozone. With the lack of ozone cosmic radiation then converts more nitrogen-14 into carbon-14 through the same process. The constant nuclear detonations established a self-sustaining ""atmospheric fire"" causing continued release of carbon-14 since the 1960s even without the detonation of nuclear devices.  
  
In the 1950s the first scientific research was published which suggested that the ozone layer was being depleted which led to the banning of nuclear testing in Antarctica in 1963. The ozone hole over Antarctica first appeared when nuclear testing peaked, it was originally thought that the ozone layer would recover within a few years after the cessation of nuclear testing however it still remains depleted today.  
  
Between the United States and Russia, over 2,600 nuclear devices were detonated: each one releasing immeasurable amounts of carbon-14. The final nuclear test by the United States took place on September 23, 1992 and the final test by the Soviet Union occurred on October 24, 1990; however it would be relatively easy for the United States, Russia, or a another nation to resume nuclear testing and there is a real risk that additional detonations could rapidly intensify climate change.  
  
According to SmarterChild the only practical way to clean the atmosphere in the short-term is probably reducing the amount of carbon-14 by converting some of it into carbon-13 with the use of high-powered lasers.",,,,1626779824,{},h5v2acb,False,t3_omg95e,False,True,t1_h5v08xu,/r/ethereum/comments/omg95e/the_most_beautiful_part_of_ethereum_is_the/h5v2acb/,1626933270,1,True,False,ethereum,t5_2zf9m,,0,[],[],text,t2_b8chb29,False,False,,

* If you run or create any kind of platform that allows users to upload images and share them, then unless you send every image to Microsoft, then you risk getting your door kicked in and your servers seized.
* If you use this service heavily then you must pay a license fee, essentially regulatory capture that levies a tax on every image sharing service and ISP, forcing them to be for-profit or sell user data.
* We are not allowed to know how the images are fingerprinted, or to have a list of illegal fingerprints. The process is secret and takes complete images in order to prevent ban evasion.
* As part of the license terms, you're not allowed to say ""this image is illegal"", you have to quietly censor it. So it forces dishonesty by providers.
* We're not allowed to possess or view this highly illegal data, so we can't actually verify whether it's actually illegal or we are being lied to.
* ""Non photographic child abuse images"" (e.g. illegal artwork) are also flagged, and there's at least one case of an Australian being prosecuted for possession of a GIF depicting The Simpsons having an orgy. Distasteful, shocking, obscene art that isn't actually child abuse can detected and reported by the filters.
* The effect of uploading every image to Microsoft's PhotoDNA service is they are also sent via American military intelligence (NSA). So classified photographs and documents can be hashed by the US and allied militaries and detected in real-time as they are shared on any platform on the web, as well as them passively getting a copy of every image of every person or document ever published. We'll never know how American military contracts have been won by industrial espionage that this enables, or how many scandals have been contained thanks to early warning systems here.
* Because local ISPs in oppressive regimes also use the service to fingerprint and filter images, it's likely had a chilling effect on whistleblowing worldwide. We'll never know how much corruption went unchecked, how many journalistic sources were outed, how many real rapes and murders were covered up, or elections were stolen. But I bet it's nonzero.
* Independent researchers can't create new novel ways to preemptively detect and block CP because the training sets are illegal and the metadata is secret, this must be done under special license by authorized people (Microsoft); innovation in this area is impossible.

You might think that these issues are a reasonable compromise given the alternative, but it's pretty uncharitable to dismiss people who disagree as paedos or cognitively rigid. It's a real issue that has been weaponized by a multitude of parties, pretty much exactly how the like crazy libertarians and anarchists warned everyone that it would.

Bitcoin is the store of value de facto, simply because everybody agreed upon it. This will not change, because changing it would create a trust issue in the market. 

If Bitcoin cannot be the store of value, why any other coin could be safe ?

There is no technical issue with bitcoin if you consider it as gold-reserve. 7tx/s is perfectly fine if you transfer a large amount of value between institutions and wealthy people. 

The BTC market cap will stay around 10% of the total market cap of the industry, so there is more money to make with other coins for sure.

Ethereum is riskier because the value comes from the tech, and there are many competitors which are or will be ahead of it. 

Currently, it has the first-mover advantage, but nobody can tell if it will be enough.

Did you even read my quote? It explains the logic of the argument: ‚Äúunlimited tolerance should be preferred, but there are cases where intolerant philosophies will use misinformation and violence to uphold their power, at which point, there should be persecution of the intolerant instead of indifference‚Äù. Popper‚Äôs argument is sound because speech being uttered by those who use violence/threats and misinformation to discredit other speech is going to push out the victims of that intolerance. Just saying ‚Äúno you‚Äôre wrong, Popper‚Äôs wrong too‚Äù isn‚Äôt even a logical argument. You sound like an idiot.  

Black and white posturing as things as free and authoritarian is not the way the world works. It‚Äôs also meaningless and stupid. My point is the government literally bans certain type of speech. Certain types of speech aren‚Äôt constitutionally protected, and you can be prosecuted for that.

Or if the locations of all of those in the Witness Protection Program. Or the address of a very unpopular social activist. In person or in print the government can restrict that by punishing those publishing the speech and shutting down publication. Online they can by the use of gag orders/subpoenas. You can subpoena companies with non-immutable servers. How do you subpoena a ‚Äúdecentralized immutable social media‚Äù? The fact you can‚Äôt AND the fact that it would be easily seen by the general public (in a public space) means the government is going to view it as a national security risk.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&amp;c.**, **&amp;c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

See the section ""Protocol fees"". Apologies since this is V2, but I believe V3 has similar tokenomics.
https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/advanced-topics/fees/

&gt; At the moment there are no protocol fees. However, it is possible for a 0.05% fee to be turned on in the future.

&gt; To open a path to self-sustainability, the code for Uniswap V2 includes a small protocol charge mechanism. At launch, the protocol charge will default to 0, and the liquidity provider fee will be 0.30%. If the protocol charge is switched on, it will become 0.05% and the liquidity provider fee will be 0.25%.

&gt; This feature, including the exact percentage amounts, is hardcoded into the core contracts which remain decentralized and non-upgradable. It can be turned on, and directed by, a decentralized governance process deployed after the Uniswap V2 launch. There is no expectation that it will be turned on in the near future but it opens the possibility for future exploration.",,,,1626755631,{},h5u8pbq,False,t3_onnqei,False,True,t1_h5u7yfu,/r/ethereum/comments/onnqei/grayscale_just_launched_their_new_defi_fund/h5u8pbq/,1626916601,3,True,False,ethereum,t5_2zf9m,,0,[],[],text,t2_67xzs,False,False,,

Still, I‚Äôm happy people fund and support these efforts. Important stepping stones just like namecoin was towards a decentralized future. 

The next step will be: defi moving to the Bitcoin ecosystem. It‚Äôs the best of all worlds. It‚Äôs defi, it has the bearer asset, it has the brand and adoption levels to make it truly global. This is where the Bitcoin maxis will be proven right. Bitcoin will eat everything in the end whether we like it or not.

4.1. Cash Withdrawals
If you have a bank card (carte bancaire) then you are able to withdraw money free of charge at any cash dispenser with the CB logo.

The ATMs are called distributeurs automatiques de billets (DAB)/guichet automatique.

There are limits on how much you can withdraw in any single occasion, or over 7/30 days, depending on your type of card and the limit set by your bank.

If you exceed your limit on your card, you can withdraw money from your bank, or from any other bank, by cheque.

You do not need your own cheque book to withdraw from your own bank, as they can prepare an omnibus cheque from within the branch that you merely need to sign.

If you have not exceeded your cash limit you can also withdraw cash from another bank by using your cash card at the counter. A charge may be payable and some form of identity will be required.

You will receive a receipt for the withdrawal, which you should retain until you have checked it against your bank statement.

Increasingly, local branches do not hold any cash behind the counter.

The only way to withdraw cash is from the cash dispenser.

If you do not have you card available then you will need to complete a withdrawal slip at the counter.

You will then be supplied with a card to enter into the cash dispenser to receive your cash.

You will not need to enter any code or amount as the card will be programmed to dispense your cash. The card will also be retained by the cash dispenser.

If you withdraw money from a cash dispenser using a French bank card within the Eurozone then no charges are payable.

Outside of the Eurozone withdrawing money from a cash dispenser does incur a currency exchange charge, which may be proportional and/or fixed (eg 2.5% + ‚Ç¨3), depending on the terms of your contract.

In isolated rural areas, where cash dispensers may not be readily available, some banks have arrangements with local shops - butchers, bakers, tabacs, etc - that enable you to obtain a cash withdrawal through the shop. The largest of these networks is with Credit Agricole, with the service called 'Point Vert'.

Since 2018 French retailers have also been formally authorised to offer 'cashback' in their shops",,,,1626725330,{},h5sjc4d,False,t3_onina3,False,False,t1_h5shnrb,/r/ethereum/comments/onina3/gassed/h5sjc4d/,1626879086,5,True,False,ethereum,t5_2zf9m,,0,[],[],text,t2_7ibi0ol5,False,False,,

You probably end up with a system where no new users can participate after your initial intake because it's too hard to gain a rating or compete with rated users.

""de"" is a prefix that means ""not"" and ""centralization"" is ""the process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those regarding planning and decision-making, framing strategy and policies become concentrated within a particular group.""

Decentralization literally does mean that each individual or organization can decide how much they wish to collaborate or integrate with others.  So, yes, it means that within the new group people get to decide what goes on.  Consensus mechanisms exist to help those decentralized groups operate - when consensus breaks down the groups either have to work out their differences or split into smaller decentralized groups.

Now, we live in a world where power is exerted by groups to impose rules that they believe must be followed.  Sometimes, I agree with those rules.  For instance, I'd be happy to belong to a group that persecutes child predators and people who drive slow in the left lane.  That is a compromise of the ideals of letting people do what they want - but one that I am happy to live with.

However, it seems that you want to punish people who say things that you disagree with.  You specifically cite ""horrible alt right groups"" as the people that you want to persecute, so I have some assumptions about your political persuasion.
