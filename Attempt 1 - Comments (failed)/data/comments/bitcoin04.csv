They can control it just fine, don't know why you think they can't. Hypothetical example:

* 1) If/when fiat is on the back foot, remove it entirely and require bitcoin to be the method of income deposits.

* 2) You are now required to register your bitcoin addresses and cannot legally receive any income at an unregistered address (doesn't need to be income tax, this is just for tracking not necessarily the source of tax accounting). If you don't and cannot show receipts for your lifestyle going through registered addresses, apply jail/fines etc as needed until complying.

* 3) Any time bitcoin leaves a registered address of yours and goes to any unknown address, it is legally considered to still be yours until such time as it gets to a registered address of a different person, and you still owe taxes on it same as if it hadn't moved. Apply jail/fines/wage garnishing/liens/reposessions/etc as required until complying.

He doesn't have the charisma but he has the vision and the drive to get things done.  For one I think it's refreshing to have someone with less of a filter, more mission-focused rather than image-focused.  Some times it bites him in the ass when he tweets without having things checked over by a corporate pr person, but you know you at least are getting what appears to be unfiltered honest Elon.",,,,1626900812,{},h61rwya,False,t3_ooj8au,False,True,t1_h61br3o,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ooj8au/daily_discussion_july_21_2021/h61rwya/,1627066540,2,True,False,Bitcoin,t5_2s3qj,,0,[],,

Here's a good definition according to Investopedia:

What Is Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)?

Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy in which an investor divides up the total amount to be invested across periodic purchases of a target asset in an effort to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase. The purchases occur regardless of the asset's price and at regular intervals. In effect, this strategy removes much of the detailed work of attempting to time the market in order to make purchases of equities at the best prices. Dollar-cost averaging is also known as the constant dollar plan.",,,,1626900456,{},h61r2i1,False,t3_oool9d,False,True,t1_h61onu4,/r/Bitcoin/comments/oool9d/am_i_the_only_one_sad_to_see_the_price_of_btc_go/h61r2i1/,1627066072,1,True,False,Bitcoin,t5_2s3qj,,0,[],,

Since there are taxes, wealth is being concentrated like crazy in the world

It's in fiat economies where there are poor people
While at the same time the rulers (politicians and their rich friends) are filthy rich

In the bitcoin economy, no one who has been saving for a cycle (4 years) stacking sats is poor

Choose wisely

Taxes (theft) are the base to finance all the fiat monetary rules that allow the concentration

If you believe the only way to fund projects is by crime (theft) then yes, you should stay were you are, Bitcoin is not for you

About your second paragraph, you're describing fiat rules... that's not how Bitcoin works, sorry to break it to you, but you need to do a lot of research on Bitcoin

The rules of Bitcoin are public and the same for every Bitcoiner, if you don't like them, you just don't participate

Violence is not a part of the Bitcoin system
I understand fiat regimes use it for everything, but it's pointless to apply it on Bitcoin. It's impossible to alter the code by a specific order from some person or entity, that's just not how it works...

The best thing one could do for poor people is teach them how to save their own sats

Saving is the only way out of poverty and governments are doing the opposite to people, they give out brrrr money to poor people (making them dependent on governments), that money dilutes it's purchasing power and they teach them nothing about finance

&gt; Ever wonder how much of the primary energy that goes into creating electricity actual provides useful work to us as consumers? Well the answer is not much – depending on the device using electricity it’s anywhere from 30% to as little as 5%. So, where does all that wasted energy go and what can we do about it? Or is it even worth trying? To address these questions, let’s look at where electricity is lost in the delivery chain.
&gt; 
&gt; Losses in generation, transmission, and distribution First, let’s consider the primary energy that enters the electric delivery system at the input to the generator and examine how much of the primary energy is delivered to the customer. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the answer is 34%. In other words, 66% of the primary energy used to create electricity is wasted by the time the electricity arrives at the customer meter.

Other sources claim that 17% of all power generated is wasted in the generation and transmission (with or without Bitcoin). Bitcoin uses one twentieth of one percent of all power:: 0.05 vs 17.0 percent.

Bitcoin's energy usage is not a problem - there is a lot of deception being pushed.  Congratulations, you've been deceived.

With Sweden and lets say nordic countries... they have nearly completely nationalized healthcare and for that, they need to pay extremely high taxes. It provides ""free"" healthcare to everyone, but... if customers can decide between at first look free over paid, they will nearly always pcik free... private centers are going nearly bankrupt while state owned healtcare is exploding with people. 

According to what i have read, people are suffering in the hospitals waiting for doctors even a few hours. Urgent is full all the time etc. Hospitals dont have any incentive to hire good and professional experts so they hire the ones with lowest salary.

As i have said and keep in mind that i dont live there and i have it from online sources, there is everything free but at the same time, everything is missing. If you chose private hospital or doctor and pay him, you have it nearly instant and with great standard. Why people dont do that? because they tax 70 % of their income (all taxes) so even if they wanted, its too much.

I completely agree with helping the ones in need, but it should be done differently than fucking up the whle industry. Lower taxes and let people pay for their needs. Let them have money for insurance, let them have responsibility but also the choice to pick where and how they want to be treated. I would say the nearly everyone is capable and should be allowed to do that. I hate socialist systems because they promote zero responsibility while reducing freedom. They can be done differently. 

Take it all with grain of salt, i am as far from expert as one can be, logic and online sources are everything i have, so there is long road ahead of me... still, now, there is probably nobody who can convince me, that socialist systems dont produce shortages and surpluses, which are inefficient and in the long run, they lose compared to free market.

In practice, this means the government will jail you if you don't pay your taxes in fiat. They can also shut down your business if you refuse to accept their currency. This backing is just as ""real"" as the promise of shiny metal. The dollar can only go to zero if the government collapses, in which case all your investments will go to zero.

There's nothing magical about gold. It has some intrinsic value for jewelry and electronics manufacture, but its value is based on the idea that people think it's valuable.

The same goes for Bitcoin, and there's nothing wrong with that. You could argue that Bitcoin is ""harder"" than gold, due to scarcity, security and decentralization. That's why I like it, but I still target only 10% of my portfolio in crypto.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I understand that fiat currencies always go to zero.

Based on what? What major currency has ever gone to zero absent war or an economic collapse?

If you really believe the dollar is going to zero, you should buy shovels and shotguns instead of Bitcoin. If the dollar fails, the electrical grid will go down shortly after.

The Fed is *definitely* printing too much money during the pandemic, but if the Fed has been ""failing for decades"", why is inflation just now ramping up? You do realize that before the Fed, there was a panic or depression every 10 years or so?

If you're worried about inflation (as I am), it should concern you that Bitcoin drops along with other assets when inflation is in the news. It seems like an imperfect hedge, but I think the situation will improve over time.

&gt; Ever wonder how much of the primary energy that goes into creating electricity actual provides useful work to us as consumers? Well the answer is not much – depending on the device using electricity it’s anywhere from 30% to as little as 5%. So, where does all that wasted energy go and what can we do about it? Or is it even worth trying? To address these questions, let’s look at where electricity is lost in the delivery chain.
&gt; 
&gt; Losses in generation, transmission, and distribution First, let’s consider the primary energy that enters the electric delivery system at the input to the generator and examine how much of the primary energy is delivered to the customer. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the answer is 34%. In other words, 66% of the primary energy used to create electricity is wasted by the time the electricity arrives at the customer meter.

Other sources claim that 17% of all power generated is wasted in the generation and transmission (with or without Bitcoin). Bitcoin uses one twentieth of one percent of all power:: 0.05 vs 17.0 percent.

Bitcoin's energy usage is not a problem - there is a lot of deception being pushed.

Buy and hold, long term and with a strong hand. Never sell Bitcoins in any attempt to time the market. Never invest money you might need w/in the next five or ten years.

Remember: TA is pure bullshit. Day trading is for fools. Fools and their money are soon parted.

The great thing about Joe Rogan and his podcast format is you can say what you want like you were just a couple of guys having a chat in a bar or strangers that met on a bus.

People may take shit he says seriously but that has always been the case. My parents used to say ""don't believe everything you see on tv"" and i am pretty sure my grandparents said the same to them. 

Most of the time he doesnt know what he is going to talk about so he can't research it beforehand. He does get Jamie to do fact checking but by the time Jamie finds what they are talking about they have moved on to another topic. Should Jamie then bring them back and explain whats really happening or let the flow of conversation keep going.

My public education, from about 4th until 12 grade was mostly a clusterfuck.  I got to learn a lot of math, but that was kind of by mistake.  For example, I had 6 years of one foreign language, graduated, and during the summer found I was unable to use that language to give simple directions to a tourist who needed to get to a certain place.  I had extremely poor grammar and spelling. My vocabulary was rather small.  I was a very slow reader with low comprehension.  School, for me up until college, was a big tax-funded ""babysitting"" service, mostly.  

Somehow (because of the math), I got accepted to a decent University, where I became interested in actually learning things because they were interesting and because it was fun -- I had a very, very deep curiosity.  

Eventually, I realized I needed to graduate and get a job, so I did.  Maybe someday I'll go back.  In the meanwhile, I use the Internet, books, and so forth to learn new things on my own.
