[],,bradp1234,,,,,,False,[],"It is illegal speech. By definition. The official term given by the court is ""unprotected speech"".

""[In general, content-based restrictions on speech](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/IF11072.pdf)‚Äîlaws that ‚Äúappl\[y\] to particular speech because of the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed‚Äù‚Äîare presumptively unconstitutional and subject to strict scrutiny. Reed, 135 S. Ct. at 2226-27. However, the Supreme Court has recognized limited categories of speech that the government may regulate because of their content, as long as it does so evenhandedly. See R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 382-86 (1992). The Court generally identifies these categories as obscenity, defamation, fraud, incitement, fighting words, true threats, speech integral to criminal conduct, and child pornography.""

Hate speech is strictly defined to being violating if it falls under those categories. So yes calling someone a ""ni\*\*\*r"" on the Internet is allowed, but if you paired the ""ni\*\*\*r"" with ""all black people should die because they're inferior and slowing down the human race"" and then posted a picture of a gun with the words ""Negro-killer"" on it, then you're falling into true threats, incitement territory, which would then be prosecuted as a hate crime, or incitement to hate crime or something. Or if you were leaving a bar and called a black person on the street a ""nig\*\*r"" and then he starts running at you and then you shoot him in ""self-defense"", you're probably still going to jail because you incited the fight with ""fighting words"".

There is no Mussolini level of suppression here, because for long before you were ver born, courts have been tackling the issue of how to regulate speech that harms others. Hate speech is disallowed if it falls under these categories, and even when not, tends to have less de-facto protections than traditional speech (lots of judges aren't favorable to defendants who have participated in hate speech during crimes, even if it's legal).",,,,1626711239,{},h5rmduw,False,t3_omxgln,False,True,t1_h5rjzo3,/r/ethereum/comments/omxgln/aave_plans_to_build_twitter_on_ethereum/h5rmduw/,1626860795,1,True,False,ethereum,t5_2zf9m,,0,[],[],text,t2_3zyeyl6t,False,False,,

Popper‚Äôs argument doesn‚Äôt just stop there lmao, and hate speech isn‚Äôt necessarily something that can just be countered with traditional speech. How about you copy and paste in the REST of Popper‚Äôs argument instead of being disingenuous and arguing in bad faith? This is from Open Society and Enemies, literally from the part RIGHT AFTER you ended your quote:

‚ÄúIn this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise. 

But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.‚Äù

How about that? Did you read that? Or did you just pick and choose your argument because you assumed I don‚Äôt read what I talk about? I understand Popper was discussing Plato‚Äôs defense of ‚Äúbenevolent despotism‚Äù, but he was disagreeing with it. He was arguing liberal democracies with strong institutions (like the law) can hold strong against and punish the intolerant that refuse to accept being called out. He DOES NOT claim an extra judicial censorship of speech, which is why I‚Äôve been saying this whole time that social media should censor illegal speech. Hate speech, obscenity, confidential information, incitement of violence, fraud, IP-violating speech, etc. all aren‚Äôt protected speech by the way (depends on context but usually it‚Äôs not). All I‚Äôm saying is within the American legal framework those types of speech are illegal and our society as a whole have decided they‚Äôre bad for the public, which is why they‚Äôre not protected. 

Literally all of you types see the world as black and white, and fail to understand the need for nuance in anything, and the moment someone calls you out on it, you label that person as an authoritarian or whatever.

It asserts that rule by an elite, or oligarchy, is inevitable as an ""iron law"" within any democratic organization as part of the ""tactical and technical necessities"" of organization. Michels's theory states that all complex organizations, regardless of how democratic they are when started, eventually develop into oligarchies.

Christ, get over yourself.

&gt; Just look at the paradox of tolerance by karl popper. It‚Äôs a philosophical argument that explains why hate speech needs to be excluded.

That is not what the paradox of tolerance says at all, which I hasten to add, Popper did not invent (he was discussing Plato's advocacy of an autocracy). I recommend that you actually read *The Open Society and Its Enemies* rather than just picking up what you saw on tumblr. You would have read him write, for example, ""I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, **suppression would certainly be most unwise.**"" (emphasis added because you obviously need it). Of course, Popper was not Yoda but how about not claiming to read things that you have not?

Also, consider that the society that claims to stamp out intolerance is itself intolerant and therefore unjust.

Mill's *On Liberty* although I suspect it would not affect your tyrannical views.",,,,1626667709,{},h5prvu7,False,t3_omxgln,False,False,t1_h5pqnxb,/r/ethereum/comments/omxgln/aave_plans_to_build_twitter_on_ethereum/h5prvu7/,1626826893,5,True,False,ethereum,t5_2zf9m,,0,[],[],text,t2_cida0,False,True,,

... what?

&gt; How do you have privacy at all with a decentralized social media with no content moderation?

Who said it wouldn't have content moderation?

Privacy is tricky insofar as your friends' servers might recieve your data if you have a private profile, and your friends might choose untrustworthy servers. I'm not sure how you'd have to design the network's privacy model to get around that, but I also generally think people need to stop pretending their social media are ever going to involve privacy.

&gt; Anyone‚Äôs information whether it be corporate secrets or personal info would no longer be private.

If you share any of those on social media, they never were private. Decentralization changes very little of that.

&gt; I think decentralized social media is a fantasy. Even if you have a decentralized governance entity that does the content moderation, that‚Äôs still at risk of having all powerful ‚Äúbad mods‚Äù taking over, like reddit for example. You would also still have the pedophiles and Nazi complaining about censorship.

I don't think you read my comment. Have you heard of the Fediverse? Did you look it up?

It's not decentralized governance of a centralized social network, it's a decentralized network. It's a network run on multiple servers by different moderators with different moderation policies. If you get banned from mastodon.social, you can move to... writing.exchange, or start your own node. Each node does its own moderation, and if your node doesn't moderate well, other nodes will defederate with you.

Nazis will always whine. This is not meant to prevent nazis from being whiny little bitches.

&gt; Also how do you mitigate the portal from engaging in abusive content moderation? You might just end up with twitter again.

Uhhhhh what is ""abusive"" content moderation?

In the fediverse, nazi nodes get defederated. Nevertheless, Gab took Mastodon code to build its own shitty app. Every decent mastodon node defederated with Gab. Gab failed. Nazis are bad at software.

The cost of purchasing ETH is always fair, no matter what. If it rises to be $100,000 it's because that is what it is worth (in comparison to the USD). The thing that I don't think you're accounting for is that ETH is more or less a speculative asset right now (it's more of an investment than a true store of value). If ETH gets to be $100k, people will be purchasing it with more confidence than they are right now because it will have really started to approach its potential (based on speculation at first and then later by truly providing the value it strives to deliver). It will likely be that ETH is a lot more stable in another 15 years and the level of risk involved in purchasing it will be MUCH lower. So, if someone is purchasing today at $2k and another person is purchasing in 15 years at $100k, it is very fair because that person that bought today was taking on a lot more risk than the person in 2036.",,,,1626623030,{},h5n3znh,False,t3_nrfu99,False,True,t1_h0ibrep,/r/ethereum/comments/nrfu99/mark_mic_dropping/h5n3znh/,1626774045,1,True,False,ethereum,t5_2zf9m,,0,[],[],text,t2_9fxp5,False,False,,

One correction though, poor people can access '*securities*' - with minimal restrictions other than the structural and KYC ones I noted. But I get your meaning.

It's worth noting though, that at least in that summary of the Dodd-Frank law you linked, it says:

""accredited investor standards are used in determining the availability of certain exemptions from Securities Act registration for *nonpublic* and *limited offerings*, including most offerings under Regulation D.""

Emphases mine. I tried to find ""Regulation D"", but gave up on mobile PDF. But presumably that is stuff that you or I would never have had access to anyway, or at least I surely never would have wanted to. (Individual public stocks, bond funds, and ETFs are as exotic as I get.) 

I do know that that bill was intended to prevent some of the worst excesses and manipulation of the powerful, not screw the poor. The literal opposite of what we're talking about.

With no trust there's no threat for a normal node so you can host as many as you want.

Nodes make the ""roads"" in the network. The miners simply distribute the Tx over those roads. The paths of the roads dynamically reconfigure as nodes join and leave the network. When miners are split on a fork decision, the nodes pick a side and the paths redraw to exclude nodes running a now incompatible protocol. You can go out of your way to stick with the losing side but most rational actors on the network will side with the winning side unless they have some strong opinion about the decision.
