&gt;Unlike mining, running a bitcoin node is not very costly (it‚Äôs typically in the $150-400 range). However, nodes are equally if not more important than miners in achieving decentralization. The roles of nodes are to:  
Validate transactions  
Keep a historic record of transactions  
**Dictate and enforce the rules of the network.**  
&gt;  
&gt;In simple terms, nodes ensure that everybody ‚Äî from miners to users and other nodes ‚Äî plays by the rules. This can be done out of self-interest. Each user, wallet, company, mining pool, and exchange that runs a node is doing so in part to ensure they are not being cheated. Everyone running a node carries a copy of the blockchain and is responsible for maintaining and updating their copy.   
As transactions are propagated and confirmed, node operators are validating that these transactions meet the rules of the network. If a user receives a transaction that creates 1,000,000 bitcoin out of thin air, the user (and all other nodes on the network) will reject the transaction. If any invalid transaction somehow makes it into a block, all the nodes will reject the entire block and wait for another to be mined which doesn‚Äôt contain any invalid transactions.  
Bitcoin is based on consensus. **All nodes are in agreement to the rules of the network and the state of the blockchain, and will ignore anybody who is misaligned.**

Their consensus would have overridden miners' votes had the latter decided to reject it.",,,,1626530477,{},h5ilmr9,False,t3_om0e68,False,True,t1_h5ikpif,/r/ethereum/comments/om0e68/its_called_ethereum/h5ilmr9/,1626685610,4,True,False,ethereum,t5_2zf9m,,0,[],,

So the argument you are trying to make is that there was no difference between pre- and post- The Graph with regard to ease of indexing Ethereum's chain data? Be real, it took dApps months-years to build their own indexes and was a huge time sink and waste of resources/manpower. The reason dApps were able to be built so quickly in 2019 and onward was because the chain data was indexed by The Graph and made it easier for developers to make subgraphs using The Graph's data.

Developers were certainly able to build their own indexes prior to The Graph, but the reason most have stopped and instead now use The Graph is because it was bulky, inconvenient, and a waste of resources to do it on their own.  The Graph's usability and applicability was so powerful that even Solana, Avalanche, Matic *reached out* to The Graph and *requested* support. The Graph didn't ask these chains if they want to be indexed, the chains *sought out The Graph*.

I appreciate someone finally trying to give me a well-thought out argument, but it doesn't make a great case.

The difficulty bomb makes it necessarry to make a concious decision about things, and keeping the status quo is not simply doing nothing but  a decision that fe requires a delay of the bomb.  
The problem is probably less apparent with london since everyone agrees on the change and pools dont really have the option to not run it.

So the bomb is probably not enough of a warant on its own but it plays nice into things altogether.  
The real possibility is the direct reason why the bomb exists, that miners will simply keep on mining on the old chain since they've got nothing to lose as soon as the switch to PoS happenes.

&gt; In the PoS case, however, things are much brighter. For certain kinds of 51% attacks (particularly, reverting finalized blocks), there is a built-in ""slashing"" mechanism in the proof of stake consensus by which a large portion of the attacker's stake (and no one else's stake) can get automatically destroyed. For other, harder-to-detect attacks (notably, a 51% coalition censoring everyone else), the community can coordinate on a minority user-activated soft fork (UASF) in which the attacker's funds are once again largely destroyed (in Ethereum, this is done via the ""inactivity leak mechanism""). No explicit ""hard fork to delete coins"" is required; with the exception of the requirement to coordinate on the UASF to select a minority block, everything else is automated and simply following the execution of the protocol rules.

&gt;Hence, attacking the chain the first time will cost the attacker many millions of dollars, and the community will be back on their feet within days. Attacking the chain the second time will still cost the attacker many millions of dollars, as they would need to buy new coins to replace their old coins that were burned.

Anyway, one thing is certain: the Ethereum community has proven its will to make sure people can interact in a peer-to-peer way, without trying to enforce rules at the expense of everyone else, and letting anyone willing to do differently do so.

[],,DeviateFish_,,,[],,,,text,t2_k8dv3,False,False,[],"&gt; How could they have total control over the network? If majority of the nodes run the new software with the changes, then it's because the nodes decided on doing that.

Because they carry the inertia of the default choice.  Again: changes they want to put into the clients (and thus make the default implementation) cannot be opposed save for a supermajority of users *rejecting* that change by not upgrading (and turning off automatic upgrades, if they have them on)--or worse yet, are forced to coordinate a different fork that lacks the offending change.

Many people running a node are using it as a means to an end (using the network), and not because they particularly care in partaking in consensus or governance. Not all of them are actively choosing to accept the changes; they're simply picking the side of the fork most likely to win.

Forcing nodes to opt *into* governance by requiring them to take affirmative action *in support of* a new feature means that all users who do not have a preference are an implicit vote *against* said feature.  Forcing users to opt *out of* governance by requiring them to take affirmative action if they *do not want* a new feature means all users who do not have a preference are an implicit vote *in favor* of said feature.

It's worth noting that the opt-out approach incentivizes apathy towards governance. This creates a self-reinforcing system in which whomever controls the defaults has more or less total control over the network.  The more people who don't care, the more implicit votes there are in favor of the defaults.  The more votes there are in favor of the defaults, the less people care about governance, because having an opinion on the matter is decreasingly likely to have an actual impact on the outcome.

Remember: The most contention fork in Ethereum's history only managed a meager voter turnout of 5-15%.  That means up to 95% of the network had no opinion and would simply follow whatever was the default option.  To say that there was ""community consensus"" under these conditions is laughable.

Some people said Eth2 started last December when the beacon chain launches, some say it's when the merge happens, some say it's when fully executable data shards are live (which is still years away).

Eth2 is a marketing term, not an engineering term. There's no event you can point to and say ""this is when Eth2 is launched"". This is why many members of the community are trying to move away from the ""Eth2"" name all together.

Instead of talking about Eth2, it's better to talk about the various events:

1. Launch of the Beacon chain (last december)
2. EIP-1559 (in 2 weeks)
3. PoS merger

The important shift is that in these new games it's not wealthy individuals writing the rules, it's mathematicians, programmers, and communal consensus.

Currently, fully inactive validators lose roughly 11.8% of their staked ether balance. After the upgrade, they‚Äôll lose about 15.4%. In addition, validators who are slashed by the network for malicious behavior such as double-signing or double-proposing blocks will get fined 0.5 ETH after hard fork activation instead of 0.25 ETH.


The Altair upgrade also corrects a slight imbalance in the distribution of rewards. The vast majority of earnings for validators comes from votes and attestations of the correct block. Only 3% of overall rewards is earned from proposing the next block in the Eth 2.0 Beacon chain. 

After Altair, block proposal rewards will jump up to about 12.5% of overall validator rewards so that the earnings for different validator responsibilities becomes more evenly split. 

&gt;Altair is considered a ‚Äúwarm-up upgrade‚Äù meant to prepare Eth 2.0 protocol developers for a much higher-stakes upgrade upcoming later this year or early next. This latter upgrade expected to follow Altair will permanently fuse the Ethereum blockchain with the Eth 2.0 Beacon Chain and fully transition Ethereum to a PoS protocol.
