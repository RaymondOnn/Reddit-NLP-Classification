Nothing, actually, not to THAT guy. Even if it's 20% (which is highly unlikely. Maybe 20% overall spread out for awhile several years but not in one year)

* That person spent pretty much all of it since they were in an unemployed place of desperation. So their non-existent savings take no hit from the inflation rise after.

* If they live in an actually civilized nation with civilized labor laws (anywhere developed except the US, just about), their wages will have risen to match that 5% (or 20%) inflation, so no hit there either

* Any debts they had just got LESS severe, so that's an improvement.

Works out just fine, actually. So long as the entire economy doesn't collapse, of course.

Dollar Cost Averaging is an investment strategy where you pick a dollar amount and invest it regardless of price periodically. Say $100 a month. Whether Bitcoin goes up or down you buy $100 a month no matter what. Over the long term you don't stress about volatility because when the price is up you're buying less, when the price is down you're buying more. If the amount your spending each month is small enough that you won't miss it too badly, you won't stress out over the volatility that comes with Bitcoin.

Stochastic‘s.

If you look at the pattern of fund managers beating the market it looks suspiciously like a Gaussian curvature. They are **all** skilled. Every generation or two we have an exceptional talent which we recognise by the time he retires. 

Skill and strategy matter little because they get copied if they produce results and form the new average. It’s by definition the ones doing things *different* that can outperform and those rarely get recognition while they are doing it.

If skill and strategy mattered so much this wouldn’t be a thing:

I think our biggest disagreement is on the long-term outlook of the market. While I fully respect your opinion that we may not be as early as people think we are, I genuinely believe that the prospects for Bitcoin are still very promising. It offers a financial solution that is independent from sovereign control, and that, in and of itself, is enough for me. Especially when we see runaway spending in the US on thinks like “infrastructure.” 

Short term, many of your points are probably right. The OTC markets are not transparent at all; it’s difficult to read the direction of entities like GrayScale; and if we’re tracking 5%+ losses, then we ain’t beating inflation.

- The CPI data is kind of a double-edged sword. People who realize that inflation will impact them financially will seek out stores of value to preserve their wealth (with hopefully Bitcoin being a consideration). But I can’t disagree with you that many will flee to cash… and these will most likely be middle income families.
- Stimulus checks are probably done. But government spending isn’t. $4.1 trillion on the table in the US… and that money will need to be parked somewhere.
- Coinbase IPO was a direct offering and not unlike other tech IPOs recently. I wouldn’t read too much into this one. But that April 14th IPO date did mark the beginning of the downturn.

One idea for approximating that MFA would be to use a passphrase (""13th word"" / ""25th word""); and secure that in a password manager or something that requires MFA. You could also put some tiny amount in the unpassphrased wallet to detect seed exposure (""decoy wallet""). This model does introduce some risks though (what happens if your MFA provider goes AWOL?)
