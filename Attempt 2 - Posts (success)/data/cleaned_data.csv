He took Tesla and spacex‚Äôs corporate funds and personal assets to allocate a large amount of BTC and did not complete the sell-off at a high level. (Except for the part in the previous announcement), and the cost is about the same as it is now, and Musk said that he will not sell it now, and he may buy it if it continues to fall. This statement may cause the capital market to suspect that these companies and individuals of Musk may cause systemic risks due to the continued decline in BTC prices.

Full story: [https://imgur.com/a/zYjdjdC](https://imgur.com/a/zYjdjdC)     **Summary:** The scammer is impersonating ""The Bitcoin Rabbi"" but replaces the ""i"" in Rabbi with a ""j."" He supposedly can give you 10x on your investment in 5 days if you join his trading/investment company. I used the ""inspect element"" tool in the browser to create fake screenshots of ""my bitcoin wallet"" to make him believe that I had several bitcoin. I then used the same technique to create a fake conversation between me and another ""investment"" company. I got him to believe this other company offered a ""token gift"" to new investors as a sign of trust. I eventually get the scammer to compete with this other fake company and send me a $27 ""token gift.""  The scammers twitter handle is one letter off from the real Bitcoin Rabbi. The scammer replaced the ""i"" with a ""j"" so after receiving the token gift, I began replacing all ""i' with ""j"" until he figured out what was going. Since he is a Rabbi I also question him about the 7th commandment, ""Thou shall not steal.""",212,2021-07-22 03:35:54

regretfulfor,Bitcoin,"Shower thought I had about a potential source of energy for Bitcoin mining. So basically my idea will combine things I watched in 2 separate videos.   You may want to watch them as well, so you can get what I'm talking about here. It's about 6 minutes of watch time.  English isn't my first language so I may not be able to explain my ideas as clearly as I would like to.  Anyways:  First, I watched this video.  Billions In Change Official Film https://youtu.be/aqxlWeoa53s  Watch from 14:10 - 18:49   Then I watched this video  The Deepest Hole in the World, And What We've Learned From It  Watch from 2:25 - 2:51   So to summarize. The first video talks about sending Graphene cables down into the earth to be able to extract heat from below  the Earth's surface.  The second video talks about the deepest hole on Earth that goes down 12 km and it gets so hot that they couldn't dig any further because the rocks began to ""act like plastic"".  So there may not even be a need to dig a new hole for energy when one already exists.   I think Mining companies and Bitcoin billionaires have enough money and resources to explore this idea.   Manufacturing 12km long graphene cables might be costly but it's a one time expense.   I think if it can successfully mine Bitcoin profitably over the long term then it does give them the incentive to try it.  I don't have a science or engineering background so this may just be a pipe dream and I'm sure someone more knowledgeable will totally debunk this idea.",270,2021-07-21 23:58:52

arnaudmrtn,Bitcoin,"With current FUD, don't panic sell. Bitcoin's value will still go to infinity on the long term. Here is why. During these times, I see a lot of FUD around and newbies are converting their sats back into USD because they fear to lose it all. That‚Äôs unfortunate.  What are the reasons of this sell-off? They treat Bitcoin like risky stocks, get rich quick scheme or worst, they don‚Äôt understand how basic economy works They have no idea that Bitcoin changes everything and will transform our entire society for the better.  As a result, I wanted to emphasize once again why our world needs Bitcoin and reassure everyone that its value is scheduled to go to infinity on the long term.  # 1) We will always want to have more than our neighbors  Since the early ages, humans have always lived in societies to survive and evolve. Social mechanisms have bring the dominance question into the equation: in order to establish our status among our society, we want to have more money than others to show dominance.  Not so long ago, some guys found a new way to distinguish themselves from the masses even more. Their idea was to privately own businesses and make people work for them so they can keep all the profits. It is called capitalism and is still considered the best system nowadays.  # 2) Inflation makes rich richer, while making poor poorer  An interesting lever for our elites to keep earning more is infinite growth. One way to do it is to let banks print new money which will be injected into the economy. Businesses will produce more, people will have more money, making owners wealthier.  However, the more money is printed to support growth, the bigger the money supply gets, and the more prices of goods and services go up. This is inflation. As wages don‚Äôt increase at the same level, employees get less buying power over time, making them poorer.  # 3) Deflation system will never be voted by elites  Remember, governments and business owners will always want to save their privileged status. Stopping money printing, would result in deflation, which means that prices would go down and people stop buying. Why buying something today when it will be cheaper tomorrow?  At that point, companies would go bankrupt, and shareholders would lose their wealth. You know understand how this is important for them to keep inflation running. Quite easy to do : banks simply have to lower loans APR to encourage people to take credits and buy stuffs.  # 4) Inflationary system has plenty of other negative effects  Inflation is also an endless nightmare. Banks or countries borrows money from central banks but their debts will never be paid back. Instead, they take new debts to reimburse part of the old debts. Money printer will never stop. This is actually getting worst over time.  Last but not least, inflation is not a sustainable system for our finite planet. Always-increasing mass consumerism consumes always more energy and resources that are not abundant. Global warming and climate change will never slow down by itself in an inflationist economy.  # 5) Be your own bank with Bitcoin and change the system  To make things clear from the start, Bitcoin is our only hope to change the system. You don‚Äôt know who to vote for at the next elections because you don‚Äôt trust them to bring a working solution? Just buy Bitcoin and hold it. This will be your best vote to have a real impact.  Here are the 5 main reasons why Bitcoin is the only viable solution :  a) Bitcoin is decentralized: it is not governed by anyone and has been designed to follow the exact same principles and will continue to deliver as promised forever. Algorithms embraces certainty. It is the opposite of human-based government that can change rules every now and then to please their own bank account.  b) Bitcoin has a 21M max supply: this is the first time in history we are dealing with an asset that will always be absolutely finite (not even gold), and cannot be replicated. Less and less coin will be produced until 2140, making it the perfect deflationary asset, without mentioning coins that will be lost forever. It is the opposite of central banks which are printing infinite FIAT currencies.  c) Bitcoin is the most secured asset: billions of successful transactions to date and millions of wallets without a single hack to date. The more people join, the more the network is strong and secured. Bitcoin is your secured property as opposed at current systems where banks are hacked every day and could collapse or take your gold in absolute necessity.  d) Bitcoin is the most liquid asset: you are always 1 click away to send any amount to anyone, at any time, and anywhere in the world. Everyone can be its own bank without any government intervention or third party censorship.  e) Bitcoin is the perfect ledger: blockchain technology keeps perfect track of every transaction that has ever happened. You would rather buy your drugs with cash than buying them with Bitcoin. Same principle with corrupted governments in a lot of third countries.  # 6) Bitcoin is a store of value asset above all  As you have probably noticed, and despite what is written on the Bitcoin white paper, I want you to treat Bitcoin like an store of value asset first. The currency/cash feature is just the cherry on top the cake that Satoshi offered to us.  However, as each Bitcoin transaction is considered  a taxable event in many countries, this does not advocate for a currency usage. The high transaction fees are also a challenge that will need to be adressed. There are layer-2 solutions like lightning network that will help in that matter.  # 7) Bitcoin is incentiving holders to think long term  Bitcoin being deflationary, it encourages people to hold their sats on the long term. Nobody wants to sell their bitcoins into a weaker currency that is losing more value over time. Never compare the price of 1 BTC to USD, this is pointless as USD price will go to infinity because of infinite money printing. This is why 1 BTC will always be equal to 1 BTC.  To judge Bitcoin‚Äôs value, think instead on its USD market capitalization and compare it to other scarce asset market caps. Bitcoin still has room to grow 10x its current price to have the same value of gold. 100x to have the same of real estate. If you consider that Bitcoin is scarcer, more secured, and more liquid than these 2 assets, I let you imagine how early we still are.  I hope this summary will help people to realize how important Bitcoin is for our future. It is our escape gate to a fair, inclusive and sustainable world. Buy, hold and spread the word around you!  And that‚Äôs all I have to say about that.",1163,2021-07-21 23:01:35

SatanicSpoon,Bitcoin,"Was the market crash 3 months ago organic or artificial ? I hear so many people saying it was a ‚Äúnatural price correction‚Äù. And while it is true that prices were in fact inflated, the price dip went way beyond what a ‚Äúcorrection‚Äù is supposed to be.  The market did in fact panic, but I hypothesize that the initial shock was artificially created by a bunch of whales dumping coins into the market to benefit from said shock and buy up later at much lower prices (thus explaining the initial dump right before the crash).  I blame whales for many of the problems and flaws in the crypto market. Without them a lot of ‚Äúprice corrections‚Äù would go out of control as we currently see along with many other problems that would simply disappear or at least be mitigated.  The only good thing we got out of this market crash is that some companies finally started taking care of the whale wallet problem. Glad to finally see companies the likes of Genesis Pool banning whale wallets in their communities. Maybe other companies will soon follow suit and start putting some pressure on whale wallet action.",195,2021-07-21 22:04:21

itfwg,Bitcoin,"Elon misunderstands energy use, block size, and block time for Bitcoin. The B Word response. Elon, the energy cost from bitcoin mining is proportional to its monetary value. Mining is a competition where each participant is incentivized to spend as much money on equipment and electricity as it is profitable. This market will exist for any truly decentralized cryptocurrency. Other cryptos cost less to mine right now because they are worth less, not because they provide more transactions per block. Bitcoin started with just one computer in 2008, using a CPU to process blocks. It could scale back down to that size one day if people stopped valuing it and discontinued mining. The majority of energy used to mine is not spent on processing and recording transactions, it is spent on ‚Äúrolling dice‚Äù for a chance to be the winner of each block and receive the associated transaction fees and block reward. Elon, your affinity for other cryptos with increased block size and block time may be functional for some nodes who have access to gigabyte Ethernet and abundant hard drive space, but that‚Äôs not scalable globally right now. People in many countries cannot afford multiple terabyte hard drives to store the entire blockchain. Currently, Bitcoin requires less than one Terabyte, and that‚Äôs after 10 years of use. The risk of such a change, to faster block times and larger block size is that we could see a choke point emerge with cloud hosting becoming the only way to support and participate in a larger blockchain network, as is the case for E, which relies on Amazon Web Services running Infura. E is not decentralized and will become increasingly political with proof of stake, if they are able to make that transition. The point of bitcoin is to overcome human systems that can be influenced by majority stakeholders, lobbyists, or law makers. Bitcoin is a responsive system that scales up and down, seeking out stranded energy, providing a new way to use excess energy globally.

OkStart1999,Bitcoin,"Coinbase account compromised Hello today I was taking a nap from about 10:30am-12 and when I woke up there was a notification from Coinbase that said my password has been reset. Now that obviously wasn‚Äôt me, nor did I authorize anybody to reset my password. I tried to log in with my old password which didn‚Äôt work, so I filled out the forgot my password form and expected an email back with the link to reset my password, but it never came. Tried again a few times but never any email back from Coinbase letting ME reset my email, tho the password was changed from somewhere else this morning. So I further went on to lock my account via phone call, all that needed was that I was calling from the phone number associated with my Coinbase account. I have 2FA set up for my Coinbase account. My question here is, with 2FA set up, if somebody did successfully change my password and try to log in, wouldn‚Äôt it ask for my 2FA,? but since they already got as far as resetting my Coinbase password do they have any shot at having access to my 2FA too,? Or is the 2FA strictly only on my phone. Sorry if it‚Äôs confusing, just a very large amount of crypto is in my Coinbase portfolio and I am very depressed now looking for answers and hoping that if somebody did try to log in to my account that my 2FA might of saved me.",251,2021-07-21 19:01:38

CoinCollector567,Bitcoin,"My BTC journey... The first time I heard about BTC was during the 2017 bull run. Like most people who heard about it for the first time I invested a very small amount without really understanding anything about what it was or did. My only aim was making a quick return so I could buy those lambos!!   However, once the price peaked out and started to drop and the value of my holding when down and down, in fiat terms. I didn't sell and instead just chose to forget about the investment altogether. A few months later a video about BTC popped up on my recommended youtbe feed. I then remembered that I had some BTC and decided to watch the video. Can't remeber what the video was about specificially but it was interesting enough to make me want to research more about the topic.   Over the next few weeks and months I then researched as much as I could about BTC, how it worked, what its uses were etc. I also became increasing concerned about the exteremly loose fiscal and monetary policy employeed by western governments and central banks. These two reasons convinced me that I needed to get some more BTC in order to help prepare myself for the future.  I didn't do any crazy trading stragegies or YOLOs, instead I started dollar cost averaging into BTC from early 2019 onwards, not large amounts since I was at university and didn't have much money but as much as I could spare each month. Since then the price has had its ups and downs and occasionally I fall into the habit of thinking in hindsight that I should have bought more there or sold out there but in general I have stopped paying attention to the price and instead focused on getting enough fiat to continue buying BTC!  I think what people can learn from my story is that it doesn't matter when you hear about BTC but how you approach it after you do. Once you do your research on the topic it really does open your eyes to a whole new way of thinking about money, the global economy and of course personal freedom. So to everyone reading this keep on stacking BTC and focus on yourself not the price flucuations!!",384,2021-07-21 16:04:42

My understanding is that instead of Bitcoin, I will receive 1.5x points per $1 spent the card but that's it is actually rewarded in ""BlockFi Cryptocurrency Rewards Points."" Once the points are deposited into my BlockFi account, it then gets converted into bitcoin.  My question is: How does BlockFi determine how much Bitcoin is actually received?

Example: $10,000 spent = 150 BlockFi Cryptocurrency Rewards Points = ??? Bitcoin  If the 150 Rewards Points = $150, then that amount of Bitcoin rewards could vary depending on the time it's rewarded to me and price of Bitcoin at that time.

xcryptogurux,Bitcoin,"Visualizing Bitcoin Lightning Network growth and Taproot upgrade explained What is Lightning Network? (ELI5)  Lightning Network is a decentralized layer-2 network protocol that uses a native smart contract scripting language to enable instant, almost feeless Bitcoin payments.  On the Lightning Network, both parties to a transaction are required only to have a sufficiently funded open channel on the network. This is done through a single on-chain transaction.  If there is a direct channel open between the parties, the transaction is routed directly and incurs zero fees. Without a direct channel, the transaction is routed through routing nodes.  Whan a transaction passes through a routing node, it is referred to as a ""hop"". There are currently 23k nodes on the Lightning Network with 13k nodes having active channels.  Three years ago, Lightning Network was admittedly far from ideal.  *Processing img h9ll0z9rwkc71...*  But the network has seen exponential growth since, particularly this year. Lightning Network is now nigh-on a fully functional global payments network secured by the Bitcoin blockchain. Lightning wallets have also come a long way and are now very intuitive to use for the average user.  *Processing img 1auw5sjvwkc71...*  Network capacity has doubled this year. Likewise, nodes and channels have grown exponentially,  reducing the number of hops, channel lifespan and fee incurred for hops through routing nodes.  *Processing img cow6o2aywkc71...*  The growth of the Lightning Network has inspired some pretty cool developments this year,  Following the success of the Bitcoin beach project, a pilot for Lightning Network's viability as MoE, El Salvador has adopted Bitcoin on the LN as legal tender.  Other countries like Tonga, Colombia and a few other LatAm countries have expressed interest to follow suit.  Twitter will launch a tipping system on its platform later this year using the Lightning Network.  *Processing img gd1odw5qxkc71...*  **Taproot**  Now with Lightning Network's maturation as an instant, almost feeless, infinitely scalable decentralized global payments network, Bitcoin is shifting focus to its next big milestone, Taproot.  Taproot brings a set of protocols that further enhance Bitcoin's scalability through even more efficient use of block space by introducing a new type of output - Pay to Taproot (P2TR).  P2TR uses Schnorr signatures, which are more compact than the conventional Elliptic Curve Digital Signing Algorithm (ECDSA) signatures. Schnorr signatures are between 6 and 9 bytes shorter than ECDSA.  An even more exciting aspect of Schnorr signatures is that it enables the aggregation of multiple signatures into a single signature. This opens up infinite possibilities, including being able to execute multi-sigs and L2idechain smart contracts as a simple regular transaction on-chain.  It's a truly game-changing development, as it allows Bitcoin to have smart contract protocols without bloating the blockchain layer.  Taproot also includes optimization for the Lightning Network called Point Time-Locked Contract(PTLC). PTLC replaced Hash Time-Locked Contract(HTLC). PTLC uses adaptor signatures which enhance privacy and security on the Lightning Network, enable escrow contracts in Lightning channels and allow users to retry stuck payments.  *Processing video nvwgc9n9vkc71...*",491,2021-07-21 14:54:33

Those who live in these united States or Canada would be living in squalor if it was not for oil, coal and natural gas. To think at this point you could possibly live without these energies is just your own inability to grasp what these energies have done to create the way we live asnd at this point there is no way green energies could displace them. They have made our lives easier and better.   The energy bitcoin uses is energy people are willing to buy in the energy market place to run the bitcoin network. Good bad or whatever. It has to do with the freedom to use your own wealth to purchase goods and services for whatever you choose. This includes energy.   So lets go here since bitcoin is a waste of energy so is all the energy you use to power your TV, Cell Phones, jacuzzis, dish washers, hair dryers, irons, washer dryers and air conditioners they too are all unneccessary uses of energy. A waste of energy not needed. You can not use these devices because I see them to be waste. Buses and trains not filled with human bodies is a total waste of energy street light on highways. Streets parking lots are also a huge waste of energy. Wall Street is a huge waste of energy online gambling, concerts, sports events all a waste of energy.  Control is control.

To encourage adoption, education is key. In this track, we aim to correct mainstream narratives about Bitcoin, debunk the most common Bitcoin myths, and offer insights and real-world experiences on its various benefits.     https://www.thebword.org/c/track-1-demystifying-bitcoin     Bitcoin As A Tool For Economic Empowerment, featuring Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk, Steve Lee will moderate this live panel discussion where nothing is off limits!     https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment     Thanks to millions of open-source developer hours, Bitcoin no longer is considered an obscure cryptographic toy. Instead, it has become an open-source financial network. In this track, our speakers explain why Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term success requires a sustainable funding model for open-source developers to maintain and extend the protocol.      https://www.thebword.org/c/track-3-Supporting-the-Developer-Ecosystem     Bitcoin's security is predicated on the accuracy and robustness of the software and hardware running it, and the actions of those participating in the network. As the use of Bitcoin grows, the security of the network must grow and strengthen. In this track, our speakers detail why supporting Bitcoin requires understanding and proactively addressing its security risks:    https://www.thebword.org/c/track-4-securing-the-bitcoin-network     Contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin is not an unregulated asset. As the next wave of participants adopt Bitcoin, it is imperative to continue to educate policymakers and advocate for sensible regulatory approaches to Bitcoin.

When I was paying for my new haircut my barber said  ""screw them. I accept just cash"".   He didn't say who ""them"" is, but it doesn't matter. ""They"" are real for him and he doesn't want them to stand between him and me.   I may be stupid, but after years of casually reading about btc, his statement made me finally understand what ""electronic peer-to-peer cash with limited supply"" really means.   And why the idea is huge.  After I made this realisation, I will never go back to the ""store of value"" narrative. This is just for rich pricks and moonbois who want become rich pricks too. Store of value is just fancy gold and not a better world for everybody.  I will never be fanatic about any altcoin again. It takes a Satoshi Nakamoto and many many years of gaining trust for a project to get a chance of becoming the world currency.  Unfortunately... I also realised how far away we are from achiving Satoshi Nakamoto dream.     We can't use Bitcoin directly, we have to rely on LN, which isn't perfect at all...    Bitcoin is not anonymous as it could be...   There are so many whales with malicious intentions...      Today I understood how great Bitcoin is and it made me sad.  I know all the alternative coins and I don't like them.   *(And I just had this another vision, where we have a working proof of unique human algorithm and could build a better and faster BTC 2.0 where all citizens of the earth become their share of the currency over a period of a few years and everyone agrees to use it over this time...)*",302,2021-07-21 11:53:33

Even if you buy more than a single bitcoin you're actually just buying millions of satoshis. This would make bitcoin a penny stock which makes sense as to why it's so volatile. A 1 million dollar bitcoin seems plausible when you look at it in terms of a 1 dollar satoshi. Even a billion dollar bitcoin makes perfectly logical sense if you look at it this way.

Ok_Barracuda_9334,Bitcoin,"If You Own 0.25 BTC Then You Own More Bitcoin Than 99% Of The World!  This is not opinion. It is mathematical fact. There is really no way around it as long as we make two assumptions. 1.) There will be a maximum of 21,000,000 BTC ever. If there is less (which there is) this only proves my point further. 2.) The population of earth stays at 7,700,000,000 or increases. If the population were to decrease then my numbers would be off a little but it will still hold true. With those assumptions, the fact is that if you own 0.25 BTC now or in the future... that you own more Bitcoin than 99% of the world. This is not arguable. There are a maximum of 21,000,000 coins so let‚Äôs pretend they are all available. None are lost or in Satoshi‚Äôs wallets. 21,000,000 / 0.25 BTC = 84,000,000 That means there are 84,000,000 segments of 0.25 BTC available. 84,000,000 / 7,700,000,000 = 0.010901 So as long as you own 0.25 BTC you own more bitcoin than 99% of the world. You are in the top 1%! And in reality, we know that only 18.5m have been released. And 1m is in Satoshi‚Äôs wallets and they say 3m has been lost. If that‚Äôs the case then lower the 21,000,000 to 14.5 million and you would only need own 0.20 BTC to have more than 99% of the world. Again, there is no getting around this. It is fact. It doesn‚Äôt matter if 1 person had the other 20,999,999.75 bitcoins. Your 0.25 BTC means you own more than 99% of the world. You would not necessarily be in the top 1% of bitcoin holders. You simply own more than 99% of the world. It is impossible for you to fall out of that number if you have a quarter bitcoin. 0.25 and HODL  If you have 0.25 BTC at the moment, you have the equivalent  of  8000$ in a savings account. The average American has about $4,500 in savings. By 2026, BTC will likely be over $100,000, putting that 0.25 BTC at $25,000. So, long before all the Bitcoins are mined (around 2140), that small amount of BTC (0.25) will exceed most American savings by factors of 10 or 100. By 2031 (about 10 years away), you'll likely have a comfortable nest egg for retirement ($250,000), assuming you own your own home, have a good 401k retirement plan and medical coverage. If you have 0.25 BTC, you're a very lucky person. But don't let it go to your head. Live modestly, eat healthy and keep fit. No one enjoys regular visits to the hospital, even if the doctor is a nubile blonde who does amazing things with her glove.  According to markets research. ‚Äú The cryptocurrency market, this market was valued at USD 541.0 Million in 2017 and is expected to reach USD 2,902.0 Million by 2023, at a CAGR of 32.31% between 2017 and 2023. The cryptocurrency market is witnessing significant growth because of the benefits of compliance-free peer-to-peer transaction, cross-border remittance transfer, and increase in use cases, as well as some macro drivers such as volatility in the stock market and fluctuating monetary regulations in different countries. The growth of the cryptocurrency market is further propelled by the transparency and immutability of the distributed ledger technology and benefits such as faster transaction and reduction in total ownership cost.‚Äù This clearly indicates that the various benefits of cryptocurrencies coupled with the fact that it acts as insurance against national economic failure has helped it find many takers. It would not be far-fetched to see cryptos fast becoming the currency of choice in 2030 as it epitomizes personal freedom.  https://twitter.com/0xbitdani?s=11",618,2021-07-21 08:59:07

Bitcoin is high-level money made in January 2009. It follows the considerations set out in a whitepaper by the bewildering and pseudonymous [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://cult.today/a-week-in-which-we-are-all-satoshi/).  The identity of the individual or people who made the innovation is as yet a secret. Bitcoin offers the guarantee of lower exchange charges than conventional online installment instruments and, not at all like officially sanctioned monetary standards, it is worked by a decentralized position.  [Bitcoin](https://cult.today/category/max/bitcoin/) is a sort of cryptographic money. There is no physical bitcoin, just correspondence kept on a freely available report that everyone has direct permission to. All bitcoin trades are affirmed by a huge proportion of handling power. Bitcoin isn't given or supported by any banks or governments, nor is an individual bitcoin important as an item. In spite of its anything but being legitimate delicate in many pieces of the world, bitcoin is famous and has set off the dispatch of many other cryptographic forms of cash, overall implied as altcoins. Bitcoin is ordinarily contracted as ""BTC.""   ## KEY TAKEAWAYS   ¬∑ Dispatched in 2009, bitcoin is the world's greatest advanced cash market capitalization.  ¬∑ In contrast to fiat cash, bitcoin is made, appropriated, exchanged, and put away with the utilization of a decentralized record framework, known as a blockchain.   ¬∑ Bitcoin's arrangement of encounters as a store of huge worth has been wild; it has gone through a couple of examples of win and fizzles over its modestly short future.   ¬∑ As the soonest virtual cash to meet far and wide notoriety and achievement, bitcoin has propelled a large group of other digital forms of money afterward.   ## Understanding Bitcoin  The bitcoin system is a grouping of PCs (similarly insinuated as ""center points"" or ""backhoes"") that all run bitcoin's code and store its blockchain. Symbolically, a blockchain can be considered as an arrangement of squares. In each square is a collection of trades. Since all of the PCs running the blockchain have comparative once-over of squares and trades, and can clearly see these new squares being stacked up with new bitcoin trades, it's not possible for anyone to cheat the system.  Anyone‚Äîwhether or not they run a bitcoin ""center"" or not‚Äîcan see these trades happening persistently. To accomplish an evil demonstration, an agitator would have to work 51% of the processing power that makes up bitcoin. Bitcoin has around 10,000 center points, as of June 2021, and this number is creating, making such an attack improbable.  Yet, on the off chance that an assault was to occur, bitcoin excavators‚Äîindividuals who partake in the bitcoin network with their PCs‚Äîwould probably fork to another [blockchain](https://cult.today/category/max/blocks-and-chains/), putting forth the attempt the provocateur set off to accomplish the assault a waste.  Harmonies of bitcoin tokens are continued using public and covered up ""keys,"" which are long series of numbers and letters associated through the mathematical encryption computation that was used to make them. The public key (basically indistinguishable from a record number) fills in as the area circulated to the world and to which others may send bitcoin.  The private key (like an ATM PIN) is planned to be an ensured secret and basically used to endorse bitcoin transmissions. Bitcoin keys should not be confused with a bitcoin wallet, which is a physical or progressed contraption that works with the trading of bitcoin and licenses customers to follow duty regarding. The articulation ""wallet"" is fairly tricky, as bitcoin's decentralized nature suggests it is once in a while taken care of ""in"" a wallet, however rather decentrally on a [blockchain](https://cult.today/do-you-really-know-how-blockchain-works/).",599,2021-07-21 08:50:08

CyberPunkMetalHead,Bitcoin,"I wrote an algorithm to buy cryptocurrency based on what coins Reddit talks about positively and I've been running it for 3 weeks, here are the results Reddit feels positively about Bitcoin? Let‚Äôs buy some. Reddit likes ALGO today ‚Äì great let‚Äôs get some of that as well.¬†  I built an algorithm to do just that, you can see a detailed guide on how to set up your own reddit sentiment crypto trading bot [here](https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/07/10/coding-a-crypto-trading-algorithm-that-analyses-reddit-sentiment/) and I have been testing it for about three weeks now.  Today it‚Äôs time to look at the overall performance, as well as how the bot logic has worked in general.  During this testing period the bot has accumulated 20 out of the top 40 coins by Marketcap: BTC, ETH, ALGO, XLM, ADA, SOL, LINK, DOGE, MATIC, XTZ, LTC, VET, DAI, CAKE, DOT, EOS, AAVE, XMR, MKR, ATOM.  The parameters I gave my crypto trading bot is to only look for keywords from the top 40 coins by marketcap, in order to stop it from buying into scams or other suspicious projects. Within 3 weeks the bot has invested in half of the top 40 coins.  Looking at some of the coins that weren‚Äôt picked up by our bot tends to reveal an interesting conclusion: USDT, BUSD, BNB, USDC, UNI, Crypto.com, SHIBA. Although these are in top 40, Reddit didn‚Äôt bother talking about them, or not positively at any rate.  What these coins have in common is that most of them are transactional tokens, stablecoins, or downright useless coins (looking at you SHIBA). As a Redditor myself, I‚Äôm quite proud of the result generated by the hivemind, yes DOGE is there but it doesn‚Äôt matter. Most coins picked by the trading bot with help of the Reddit sentiment are coins that I would invest into myself.¬†  For now the return on our investment doesn‚Äôt look so great. But then again, no accumulation strategy will perform well in a downtrend so this is not representative of the overall result. The outcome is relatively predictable, if the market is up, we‚Äôre up as we‚Äôre buying the actual asset and not using CFDs or futures trading.  Overall I‚Äôm on 15% loss, but as the entire market is down, this is not indicative of the performance. The data that does get me excited is the quality of the coins bought, which means that if nothing else, this could be an automated buy and hold diversification strategy.  See how you can set this up yourself to use in test mode or live mode (at your own risk).

madeofchemicals,Bitcoin,"Blockchain Experts of Reddit, how likely/how much more likely is a 51% attack on Bitcoin Blockchain given the Chinese ban (78.89% of recorded miners) on mining? One of the first things I made sure to remember before investing in BTC was to understand as best as possible how the blockchain works and what are it's security flaws. The original paper can be found at  [https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper)    The most important line ""As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers.""    There's something I noticed while going through hash rate data that I found quite concerning from a security of the blockchain perspective. I didn't even think to look into hash rates until another user mentioned the hash ribbon indicator on Tradingview.com  The hash rate estimated on 04/14/2021 peaked at 198.514 m TH. The hash rate estimated on 06/26/2021 hit a low of 58.461 m TH. This was found at blockchain.com using the raw values in the past year. That's a drop of 70.55% in 73 days.   [https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate)    Now, according to nature scientific journal, China made up a large percent (75%) of the mining capacity of the blockchain. If the ban was truly in effect and China miners actually shut down, the drop in hash rate would make sense.  [https://www.nature.com/articles41467-021-22256-3.pdf](https://www.nature.com/articles41467-021-22256-3.pdf)    With that large of a drop in miners, the possibility of a coordinated 51% attack because much easier, simply because the overwhelming majority of miners maintaining and building true blocks on the blockchain have been removed.  What are the short term and long term impacts if one were to occur to: price, trust in Bitcoin, trust in blockchain?     It's also worth noting that #11 Calculations in the original paper goes through the probability of a successful attack and how they could be implemented. I will say that it may not be worth trying to do the attack unless the transaction was valued greater than the cost of ((current hashrate \* amount of time maintaining blockchain) + cost of equipment), unless they are willing to waste money to really screw with someone/entity/government.  I guess it's also worth noting that El Salvador was the first country to make it legal tender, so I would say they are at the greatest risk of an attack. Just my thoughts.",395,2021-07-21 04:24:06

4homiptthrowaway,Bitcoin,"My bank shut down my account and banned me for life after trying to buy bitcoin from Kraken. What do I do? Hey guys, I will make this post short so it is quick and easy to read, I am asking advice because my bank (or rather credit union) recently did something to me that is really unfair and pissed me off, so I want to get some compensation for it or try to hold them accountable. I am pretty sure what did they is illegal/not allowed and I need some help or guidance from the community. Any help is greatly appreciated.    I live in Ontario, Canada and I do personal banking with Meridian Credit Union (I know, they're a crap company). I recently signed up for the bitcoin platform Kraken, after hearing about it here. I got verified, submitted my ID and went to make a purchase for some Bitcoin off their website. I was instructed to send a bank wire to their overseas account so I could complete the purchase. The next day I went to my local credit union (Meridian Credit Union), which is not technically a bank but for all intents and purposes works the exact same way. I had all the money lined up in my account (about 25K CAD) and was ready to buy a bitcoin (purchase was for about 0.6 BTC).    I sent out the wire and I chatted with the teller, told them I heard about Kraken and that I was buying bitcoin for the first time. Explained I saw it as an exciting opportunity and wanted to make some money off of my investment. The one teller was really nice but the other was being kind of nosey and rude. I don't want to assume things but she seemed like a Karen and kept asking where the money came from, how I got it and if it is mine, kept acting shocked that I had 25K of disposable income to spend, etc.    Anyways, fast forward a few days and the wire is not received by Kraken, despite all the info being correct. I call up my credit union and ask what's wrong, turns out the bank ""flagged"" the wire for ""Security reasons"" or suspicious activity. Eventually after a week of fighting with them over it, the wire was eventually reversed and bounced back into my account (minus a 50 dollar fee). I was not able to buy the bitcoin and my bank blocked me from sending a payment to Kraken.    That alone would be fine and I would have moved on, but it gets worse. About a week or two later, I got a call from my credit union (Meridian) and they called me to inform me I was permanently banned from Meridian and they would be closing down my account, and I had to come withdraw all my money so they could close it. I asked if I could be reinstated and they said no, I was banned for life and I wouldn't be allowed to reopen a new account. I asked why and they said over the phone there was ""suspicious or illegal activity"" coming from my bank account, and they could not work with me any further. I am not involved with any illegal activity whatsoever, my income is 100% legal (I work for a company and get T4 slips) and it was my first time ever buying bitcoin in my entire life. It seems like the conversation I had with the teller about Kraken ""tipped them off"" and they misunderstood it as being something illegal.    Based on the harshness of the lady's tone over the phone, I am worried they possibly even alerted authorities or tried calling the cops on me because of this stupid Karen who works at the bank. I now have to switch banks to a new provider (eg BMO or RBC) and every time I go to Meridian now (for things like cancelling my cards or withdrawing my money) the Karen at the teller gives me a really hard time.    So what gives? This is absolutely ridiculous and I did not expect this to happen. What do I do? Is there any way I can try complain somewhere or demand some sort of compensation? I feel like the whole situation is extremely unfair and a big misunderstanding, and I also don't even think a bank or credit union is allowed to do this to someone, especially a paying customer. So what do I do? What are my options for demanding compensation? Is it possible to take legal action against them or is doing so a waste of my time?    Any help or advice is appreciated.

Expired_Lizard_Milk,Bitcoin,"Companies should sell products at fixed bitcoin prices no matter what the usd value is I think if we want to see any price stability with bitcoin then companies should sell their products at a fixed bitcoin price in order to establish price floors.  For example, let's say a tesla model 3 was priced at 1 bitcoin. No matter what the price of bitcoin is in terms of USD this car will always sell for 1 bitcoin. This helps create a price floor for bitcoin. People would be incentivized to buy up bitcoin at current prices because they know they'd be getting a deal if they were to buy something worth 29k and use it to purchase a car worth 35k. The demand of people wanting to buy bitcoin in order to get a discount on the car would actually push the price up back to 35k.  Another option companies can do would be to buy up large amounts of bitcoin over the counter at today's prices and then offer product at extremely cheap bitcoin prices. For example, a company like Lamborghini could theoretically purchase a billion dollars worth of bitcoin OTC today for $29k per bitcoin. They then announce that the newest Lamborghini model will sell for exactly 1 bitcoin no matter what the current USD price is. Imagine people finding out that they can buy a 300k car for just 1 bitcoin which is currently at 29k... this would cause the price to skyrocket and we'd potentially see a new price floor near 300k for bitcoin due to all the demand from people buying up cheap bitcoin today in order to purchase a very luxurious car. Lamborghini as a company then benefits vastly because their OTC purchase of 1 billion dollars of bitcoin is suddenly worth 10 billion. They also wouldn't be losing any money selling a 300k car for 1 bitcoin today because pricing their latest Lamborghini at 1 bitcoin would create enough demand to establish a price floor at 300k.",334,2021-07-21 01:05:53

Trenchcoat_Economics,Bitcoin,"Big Tech's next move for Bitcoin tomorrow? I think so.  Completely hammered by sustainability FUD.   Quick recap. Here are the events of thinking us westerners used to get here this cycle, as per the public‚Äôs focus and the media's amplification:  1. **Jan 8 Elon Musk puts Bitcoin on TSLA‚Äôs balance sheet, plans to accept payments**  *‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if it makes sense for TSLA to buy Bitcoin \[‚Ä¶\] but I do think it could be a catalyst for sustainable energy.‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäFrom the Ark Invest Podcast Feb, 2019*  The corporate treasury move was foreshadowed by his Twitter interactions with Michael Saylor  2**. Bitcoin consumes energy and therefore results in CO2 emissions (exponentially so during euphoric price action)**  Which he was surely aware of beforehand   3. **TSLA stops accepting Bitcoin as payment may 12**  ESG pressuring TSLA is a highly likely outcome for this cyclical problem in which Musk has no choice but to comply, and it's not worth the publicity hazard if his company were complicit.  So far as I see it, there are two possibilities. Elon had basically no idea what he was doing, and recklessly gambled with TSLA‚Äôs balance sheet. Or this is somehow a favorable situation. He is bringing attention to the problem before presenting the solution.    # ""Tesla will resume accepting bitcoin payments for its cars once miners of the cryptocurrency can show they are using roughly 50% clean energy""   \- Elon's twitter (a somewhat reliable source)  We shouldn‚Äôt put the man on a pedestal, or assume he‚Äôs altruistic. There are plenty of incentives within the largest crypto communities for him to maneuver. Big Tech shall have their way regardless, as they offer valuable influence in the battle of information. In this battlefield social media is already the marketing frontier for such debates, while traditional media is at best only incentivized to cover the controversies. Terms like ‚Äúgreen-washing‚Äù imply cultism, or more importantly, that no debate is worth hosting.  But for Proof of Work blockchain technologies, it may be the most interesting topic to consider. Ominously, it‚Äôs the cliff hanger Hal Finney‚Ää, ‚Ääearly contributor and first receiver of Bitcoin‚Ää, ‚Ääleft as his last tweet related to the crypto.  [https://i.imgur.com/nyoZTav.png](https://i.imgur.com/nyoZTav.png)  To be clear, neither side is currently capable of fully proving their point. Jack, Cathie and I‚Äôm sure Elon will put on a good show. If the mining counsel‚Äôs data is considered reliable and more complete, it‚Äôll unlock a more resilient narrative for Bitcoiners. If their ventures create economic incentives for developing sustainable infrastructures, in it may change the whole ball-game.

catsx3,Bitcoin,"Update to the situation in which I sent $5000 in btc to the wrong address. I got the money back! (Original story linked inside) This is a follow up to   https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/oda6uf/accidentally_sent_btc_to_an_input_address_from_a  This all began on July 3rd.  After I noticed the wallet I sent it to was an output address used by Kraken I immediately emailed them asking for help and what my options were.   Over the course of the next week I sent many emails back and forth explaining the situation and how I meant to send it to a Coinbase wallet but accidentally long-pressed on an output address used in the transaction from Kraken to my Electrum wallet.  Finally they send me an email saying they've identified the owner of the account and would be emailing them to ask if they would allow their email to be shared with me so we could actually speak and resolve the situation.  The guy ended up being from Brazil and when he received the money he moved it to an online Casino where he proceeded to lose $2000 before seeing the email from Kraken.  After seeing the email from Kraken, he actually emailed me! It took a lot of convincing that this wasn't some sort of elaborate scam and I explained that the $2k ""lost"" wouldnt be a problem if he returned the rest of the money.  He wanted me to sign some sort of contract stating what happened, we both signed it and this morning I woke up to .10 in my Electrum wallet.  Holy. Fucking. Shit.  I just want to send a huge shout-out to Kraken for helping me navigate this ridiculous situation I put myself in.  I want to send an even bigger shout-out to the man that received the coin and was willing to send what was remaining back.  I don't even care about the $2k and I'm honestly hoping he just made that story about the casino up so he could keep the $2k because he deserves it and I know $2k goes a long fuckin way in Brazil so I honestly feel like really good about it. How could I not?  I've never heard a story like this in the btc world. Ive been trading since 2013 and never made the mistake of sending money to the wrong address and the stories I've heard of people who have, I've never heard of a story of that btc being recovered in such a fashion.  I am beside myself with joy. It looks like I'll be able to buy the car I want after all.  I've always said I'm simultaneously the luckiest/unluckiest person I know and this is solid fuckin evidence right here.  THANK YOU KRAKEN!  THANK YOU UNNAMED BRAZILIAN GUY!  I quite literally thought I lost that money for good and this whole ordeal has been such a whirlwind. I'm so glad it's been resolved but it wouldn't have been if I didn't study the Blockchain and followed the money, and even then 99.9% you won't get your money back but I actually fuckin did.   I'm agnostic and this nearly made me believe in God lol  This community is amazing and it was thanks to your help in my initial post, here I am, issue resolved ,15 days later, but resolved.

The only example I've heard of is flooding the market with sell orders to spook the market, allowing you to buy in lower.

swolleddy,Bitcoin,A piece of advice I‚Äôm relatively new to the crypto space and like many of you I didn‚Äôt get in at the best prices. Ever since the dip in may I have averaged down but I‚Äôm still red. Since that dip in may I have spent way too much time staring at red candlesticks all day. That absolutley destroyed my mental health seeing my investment getting rocked and looking at it all day like a gambler. It took me a while but then it hit me: I‚Äôm getting worked up over price moves by the hour by the day which are so meaningless in the long run. For example when bitcoin was trying to recover to 40k I was so sad to see it go back to 38k. Now I wish it went to 38k. When I became aware of this I realized how stupid staring at charts are especially if I‚Äôm not even trading. I also became aware of how meanglingless price changes are. I took time away from the charts to study and understand bitcoin better and my mental health improved dramatacilayy. I used to have guh movements when bitcoin would drop and now I‚Äôm kinda numb to it. I would advise you alll to understand the tech better take a break from the charts. And read up on al the great news for bitcoin.  It‚Äôs literally being adopted. Who cares about the price rn this shows how the tech is working. What else do you need to see the bullish picture. If price was all that made you bullish you shouldn‚Äôt be here.,266,2021-07-20 18:48:16

I have been seeing people ‚Äúbuying the dip‚Äù the whole time we have been stuck in between a range. It didn‚Äôt make much sense to me. The opportunity risk of buying mid 30‚Äôs was still too high. There was always a risk of falling into the 20‚Äôs. Even now I am setting my buy orders in the low 20‚Äôs all the way down to 13k. Patience will always play a huge role in your success in this crypto game. If you‚Äôre stuck in bad positions don‚Äôt worry bc BTC is known for surprises. Who knows exactly what the end of the year will bring! My advice is to have a strategy and clear entry and exit points. Set buy orders to avoid fomo‚Äôing in and stick to your plan. Being ready for ANY situation is the best way to play the game. Good luck and happy stacking.,163,2021-07-20 18:37:23

ZypherBro,Bitcoin,"What can we learn from catastrophe theory? Many people are chartists and chase trends. When too many chartists take part in the market, its often time to take profits (hence the cliche: when your cab driver starts talking about bitcoin, its time to sell). This is what initializes market corrections like the one we have seen. Fundamentalists start taking profits, and so the trends start reverting, and the chartists then exit the market, and so we get a correction. When fundamentalists start considering the asset underpriced again, they will re-enter. And once trend reversal is confirmed, the chartists start stepping back in. Rinse and repeat. Check out this paper by Zeeman (1974): https://www.sciencedirect.comcience/article/pii/0304406874900342 . You can read it without any deep insight to mathematics. I highly recommend this paper. It is a beautiful paper imho.  I guess the takeaway is that now is a good time to start investing in BTC through DCA. You stop your DCA scheme when trend is reversed to the upside and price steps back above your average price. Then you just hold for a while, and then you start taking profits gradually as things get more heated. Dont make the mistake of not taking profits along the way. You can use the profits that you now keep in cash to reinvest in the next correction. Not financial advice by the way‚Ä¶",226,2021-07-20 15:59:30

Kind of similar to how the govt punishes car manufacturers for not meeting certain emissions standards. Now considering there‚Äôs $21 mil BTC and less than $3 mil remaining to be mined, would it even matter at this point? My thinking would be it‚Äôs more than 3/4 mined and if it became more expensive to mine the remainder that would be a good thing for driving value up, if anything. Am I wrong there?

There‚Äôs something I‚Äôm struggling to properly understand, if any of you could guide my thinking that‚Äôd be great. Here goes:  Nobody knows the fundamental value of bitcoin yet, so market moves on speculation. Everyone says that market is being manipulated by whales ‚Äì they make the price go down, small investors panic and sell, and whales buy more at downward-moving prices. But, ultimately, when the whales have had their fill, how do they make the market go up again? Is it by just spreading hopeful news and hoping there is enough trade between whatever small investors are left in the game, to drive the prices up? Or is it by starting to sell from their own stash and hoping small investors pick it up at upward-moving prices now?  If it‚Äôs the latter, what‚Äôs the catch? Let‚Äôs say they bought 1 coin at 50K, 40K and 30K each earlier. Now thy sell 1 at 30K, 40K, 50K each? Or maybe 31K, 41K and 51K, if they play it well? But is that it? Marginal profits?

Current price action is standard bull cycle consolidation (Fibonacci Analysis) **The Golden Ratio**  Some of you may not know about Fibonacci ratios but that's ok. I will not overcomplicate this post and you don't need to be a TA expert to understand it.  Suffice to say, these ratios, particularly what's referred to as the golden ratio (1.618), aren't limited to TA, but ubiquitous in all nature and cosmos.  Fans of The Da Vinci Code will remember Professor Langton explaining how mathematics and art collide via the 'golden ratio.'  The golden ratio is sometimes called the ""divine proportion,"" because of its frequency in the natural world. Space-time itself is defined by this mathematical constant. Naturally, we humans, are somehow programmed to act in accordance with this ratio in everything we do.  **Golden Ratio in Bitcoin**  Bitcoin's price action right now is following the exact same pattern that it did in 2013 and 2017. Let's take a look. These charts are very easy to follow,  [First big run, new ATH and correction to 1.618 \(2011-2013\)](https://preview.redd.it/btz4233otdc71.png?width=1558&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e202930c48f7ed3ac3e6a9c200fe3b47e3960f2)  [Same pattern \(2013-2017\)](https://preview.redd.it/0a89pscutdc71.png?width=1558&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bcf184dc809a8695e9202ff0749e9f92233ca02)  [Unerringly rhythmical \(2017-2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/w443ztdxtdc71.png?width=1559&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff4d1b5aeb6c793e396a177e9b95959452859c58)  When Steve Wozniak called Bitcoin a mathematical miracle, he wasn't kidding. Whatever makes the price action so unerringly rhythmical this way between halving cycles can be empirically analyzed by humans similar to the patterns in nature but never fully understood.  It once again begs the question if Mathematics was invented or discovered.  I was already super excited 3 years ago to observe whether the same pattern would play out again. To see it play out exactly the same way (so far) is nothing short of spine-chilling.  You can check out the two pinned posts on my profile.  In February 2018, when everyone was panicking, I pointed out that we would go back to 19k and beyond in the next cycle.  Back then, I hadn't yet analyzed the price action this closely but I knew the quadrennial cycles.  Then in December last year, I called for $100k before the end of 2021 which I still stand by.  Similar to my prediction in 2018, I understand that this may be too optimistic to imagine right at this moment.  In my personal opinion, it's very likely that 29k turns out to be the bottom for this correction phase.  But you should of course DYOR.",398,2021-07-20 15:01:54

PhrygianGorilla,Bitcoin,"I've been learning about crypto for about 6 months, is this a good description for what bitcoin is as a whole? Am I missing anything? Bitcoin is a distributed ledger that is split into blocks which are sent to nodes who save it and store it. Each block is simply a bunch of transactions from wallets. A block is generated every 10 minutes by miners who perform hash functions to achieve the target difficulty.   When the block is hashed by the miners it uses sha-256 encryption which is a 1 way cryptographic function which turns any length of data into a 64 digit hash key (256 bits). The hash of the previous block is also included in the header of the current block to allow you to go back and verify the order of blocks and to also make it increasingly harder for anyone to go back and change past transactions.   The miners hash the contents of the block but if the resulting hash isn't equal or lower than the target they try again increasing the nonce. The nonce is simply a number used once which is added to the block to see if it matches the target, if it doesn't the miners try the next number. The first miner to hash the block with the correct nonce that results in a hash below or equal to the target is rewarded with bitcoins. The miner who wins is allowed to publish the block and all the other nodes on the network store it.   The rewards are decreased every 4 years to maintain a stock to flow model similar to physical gold, by the year 2140 there will be no more rewards given out. The difficulty for mining is also increased (or decreased) every 2016 blocks (about 2 weeks) to accommodate for changing total hash power of the entire bitcoin network, this is to ensure that a block is produced every 10 minutes on average.   The changing of difficulty is simply the amount of 0's at the start of the hash target for miners. If you don't want to mine bitcoin to acquire it you must go to an exchange and buy it from someone who wants to sell it for fiat money. When you own bitcoins it is stored in a wallet on the network with the entire history of your bitcoins being traceable to when they were first mined.  Your wallet is only kept safe by only you knowing your keys to your wallet, if anyone else has access to them then they essentially have your bitcoins. You can own a hardware wallet which stores your keys offline and never leaves the device to ensure maximum safety.  Many people mistakingly think that bitcoin is anonymous but in reality it is pseudo anonymous as everything is public just without your real name. As long as you never share your wallet address online with identifying information like you name no one can know who owns your wallet, but they can still see your balance and every transaction you have made.  Please let me know if there's anything I have missed.",519,2021-07-20 14:13:16

Psychtech79,Bitcoin,The crypto wars to come‚Ä¶ So this is the problem in a nutshell.  China is coming out with their own crypto currency.  The unified forced submission of 1.5 billion people to that ecosystem will dominate the landscape.  Anyone who has ever played any online games with Chinese teams will tell you they only have one goal.  Chinese domination.  So we have team China in one corner.  In the other corner we have Bitcoin.  (Check yourself here).  Yeah we have the hundreds of alt coins and eth and all the different branches of the crypto tree.  But that‚Äôs the problem.  Chinas money will not be divided.  They will put everything they have into making sure their digital asset is on top.  So the whole time we are sitting over here jerking off on each other over what the next shit coin one hit wonder is going to be they are at war.  They are at war with Bitcoin.  It‚Äôs in the headlines nonstop.  Wake up!  Ditch all the alts and unify behind one coin.  But that‚Äôs never gonna happen.  And that‚Äôs why in the end when it‚Äôs all said and done we are going to lose.  Divided we fall.  Enjoy the ride.  Your choice.,203,2021-07-20 13:26:25

I believe there will be massive amounts of government spending the closer the millennials approach retirement age (I'm a millennial). It's bad enough that the baby boomers are having to rely upon social security, which is unsustainable on its current trajectory, for their retirement years. The millennials, comparatively speaking, have very, very little in savings and are deeper in debt than the baby boomers were at their age. The simple math leads me to strongly believe that there will be ridiculous government programs that will add ungodly amounts to the deficit by the time millennials reach their 60s.  Bitcoin, I believe, is going to skyrocket as a result over the long haul.

This is in short my experience with the second node I bring to life (first one was decomissioned for personal reasons as I could not attend it properly).... now I have time.  As said in title, we were not preteding to route for a start, but as I'm now having some fun with it there is no excuse to not keep investing some more time on it and share results with those interested. After one month of operations here you have some numbers. I'm not really sure how I got here nor if this pattern is going to continue up or down, but anyway I think is interesting to share the details. You can ask me questions, I'll try to answer them.  You can find info on the node [here](https://1ml.com/node/029b81d1aaf177fa00c1c5796360163bfa98ee4d5d0daa54c6f510d9e237f376e9). Important to note that 2/3rd of the capacity of the node is Inbound atm, and has been like this for the last 2 weeks. All public channels.  So, since the node was born on June 19th, I have routed a total of 144 Tx with a total value of aprox 16Msats, through aprox 55% of the channels opened to the node (inbound and outbound). Most of the activity started to happen like 2 weeks ago, but the node routed it first Tx already on June 20th, so in the first 24h.    https://preview.redd.it/u75ks1o7wbc71.png?width=454&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cc5d417c33cb51068d869816100f3c428881629    Most active channels are routing both ways as you can see bellow and they are routing normally mid-size (200k-700ksat) to very small amounts (&lt;10 sats).    [Here the split of sats routed through the channels](https://preview.redd.it/hvdje99bwbc71.png?width=1707&format=png&auto=webp&s=729ee5d7ce2c1286960191989c142061099e080c)    [And here a Chord Graph representation of sats flowing thorugh the channels which is cool to see changing every day.](https://preview.redd.it/d3ppbergwbc71.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=47f2e96851fcce2a96e113aac34c19641f7bf81d)  It have been very relevant for us to be very careful with sat spent on fees when opening channels or doing any kind of operation, one of the most important tools I guess for a LN operator is keeping an eye on the mempool to make sure you do any on-chain operation at 1sat/vB. In these days onchain can be even cheaper than some LN tx :P so find the moment for making loops in/out or opening new channels.    https://preview.redd.it/kyn50hbkwbc71.png?width=428&format=png&auto=webp&s=2279d9fa507d2651a9e2f8432585d45507b568ec  Well, this is it for today.

It is quietly having a bullrun in many places. #hodl   The situation may seem bear right now for those in the USA, Europe. But bitcoin is serving its true purpose in countries such as China and Argentina, it is becoming the currency for the people.  Regardless of what China posting how economy is doing well and recovering well. I can tell u food prices are going through the fucking roof in China. China GDP growth reported 20%, guess what prices of food went up by 50-100% for 99% of necessary items. Majority of the banks is banning any account associated with transferring of money into crypto exchanges. Crypto is almost the only reliable way of sending money outside of the country and holding as a steady investment. China built housing for 4billion people, and population is 1.3billion. It is bubble about to burst any time. The government controls the stock market, theres pretty much no way to make money from stock market.  My friend from Argentina say his country inflation is 50% every year the past few years. He buys bitcoin and send it back to his family monthly. It is only thing that is keeping his family afloat and not becoming dead poor.   Inflation is killing a lot of the currencies outside of USD, euros. Bitcoin is already having its own bulllrun in those countries regardless of the USD price. It is serving its true purpose as currency of the people.

mredvard,Bitcoin,"Personal stories about inflation I was born and raised in Venezuela, 6 years ago I decided to leave for good.   During my time there, I witnessed inflation and its consequences first hand, and I learned a few things that helped me maintain some of my purchase power and escape. Many, if not all of the things I will point out are obvious to many of you, many here are knowledgeable and can reach the same conclusions by studying some economics and applying simple logic, I‚Äôm not that smart, I had to suffer it.  Inflation seemed to have started to be a concern for everybody in 1984-1985 during the ‚Äúblack friday‚Äù (no, not that one you know), a day where the government devalued the currency against the dollar by 100% if I‚Äôm correct. My numbers are not exact, I‚Äôm sure if i google them i‚Äôll get them right. It probably started before that, I don‚Äôt know, point is, it was the day that entered into people‚Äôs radar. Things continued to go downhill ever since and, it hasn‚Äôt stopped.    ‚ÄúThe rich gets richer, the poor gets poorer‚Äù my dad said it ever since i have memory. It wasn‚Äôt obvious, I didn‚Äôt get it, it took me about 25 years to understand that ‚Äúthe rich‚Äù hold onto assets and not cash, as for the rest, the story is sad. This kind of statements are true but have negative consequences as people start to resent against those who have managed their finances properly and protected themselves, people will say they cheated, it is unfair! The playfield is indeed unfair, but it is not the richs‚Äôs fault. This will usually leads to social unrest, opening pandora‚Äôs box.   ‚ÄúPoliticians love to print money‚Äù if rich get richer, the politicians are not exempted, they will adjust their salaries according to the properly measured inflation rates, plus, their missmanaged projects will receive funding at the beginning of the year, so they will have a chance to spend it all before the prices goes up, and lets not even talk about their complicated corrupt schemes to pocket the surplus and deposit it in foreign currencies as a hedge.  Prof Huerta de Soto explains monetary expansion is usually done in a way that spreads like honey being poured on a plate, those who gets it first, gets the best of it before it reaches the edge of the plate.     ‚ÄúEnjoy this year, the next one will be worse.‚Äù I heard this so many times, even on TV shows. It is some sort of ‚Äúpositive‚Äù statement for you to cheer up now and enjoy the moment, I‚Äôm not sure if it ever worked. Inflation is a degenerative process, like a disease, it wears down your income, your quality of life, your health. Its consequences can be seeing in the society in general, everythings seems to be in a constant state of decay, first people lose the power to buy their hobbies, then new clothes, then expensive food, then snacks, then cannot afford 3 meals a day. But they still have jobs, and this will lead to my next story.   ‚ÄúInflation doesn‚Äôt kill jobs‚Äù it actually does but, let me explain. Is not an atomic bomb that pushes company to declare bankruptcy or forces them to fire everybody in a shocking event. Is toxic gas that slowly kills you, most companies won‚Äôt cease to exist, they will adjust their prices as their costs goes up, they will be forced to lower the quality of their products to compensate the lower sales, but people will remain in their desks living their normal lives, without really thinking about what‚Äôs going on, assuming that everything is just normal.   I even got used to the fact that prices will always go up, I though it was the natural course of life. It is the governments objective to feed and perpetuate this lie.  ‚ÄúCash is trash‚Äù pretty obvious right? people started trading cars as currency, anything was better than holding cash,  cars naturally depreciate over time, like houses or most material things, their rate of appreciation measured against the local currency surpassed the natural depreciation of the asset, in this context, people failed to see that those so called assets or hedges were depreciating, and as they saw their value go up measured in local currency they saw themselves as wealthier, but they were not, they just had a car in their garage.  ‚ÄúHedging made me a millionaire‚Äù I wish this would‚Äôve been true in the whole sense of the word. I didn‚Äôt become wealthier, my assets simply were valued now in millions of  the local currency, but I was simply able to afford the same things, maybe a bit more food, maybe a bit more entertainment, it is hard to see wether assets have more value or your pocket have less, or both. Hedging was not a winning lottery ticket, it was a shelter against the toxic gas, there was nothing to celebrate.  ‚ÄúCPI is in the realm of macroeconomics, not your finances‚Äù of course macroeconomics affect your finances, but doesn‚Äôt tell you the whole story of what‚Äôs happening in your pocket. The real picture of your finances is in your consumption habits and goals in life, food prices affect you, but if you are hedging against inflation, the inflation of those specific hedges affect you dramatically. If cpi inflation is at 80% annualy but your hedge is inflating 1000% annualy then inflation for you is 1000%.",911,2021-07-20 03:43:09

I sell you a laptop for .25 Bitcoin on that same Monday when the value is $10,000 per coin. ($2,500) for said laptop. Then say Friday rolls around and the price of Bitcoin has dropped to $7,500 per coin, so if I sold you the laptop for .25 Bitcoin I would be making less than I did on Monday in profit (about $625 less).

MrKilluaZoldyck,Bitcoin,"Do you guys think the recent price dip 3 months ago was a market crash or a price correction ? I personally believe it‚Äôs a crash and that there was foul play involved. While the prices were in fact inflated, the sudden drop in prices went way beyond what a ‚Äúcorrection‚Äù is supposed to be.  I think it‚Äôs the works of a couple major whales that wanted to capitalize on a price dip and thus created an initially artificial dump that then grew into an organic market panic (this would explain the individual dump that occurred right before the prices dropped)  Like I‚Äôve always said, whales are a PLAGUE to this market in every way possible. And while removing them completely impossible, I‚Äôm glad to see some companies working against them. Some companies like GPool have a zero tolerance community and platform that makes it really hard for whales to single handedly control how the projects will perform.  A price correction would be the easy way to describe what happened. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that simple. We need more companies and platforms to form limits on the games whales are playing.

SatOnMyBalls_,Bitcoin,"Anyone here old enough to remember what happened when banks first started offering their clients Apple stock?    If not, here's a quick recap: The media told everyone that Apple was not a good stock to buy or hold and that everyone who owns it should sell it before it crashes and dies during its early days, all while at the same time Banks were adding it to their asset catalog, blocked a majority of their clients from being able to buy it, and only allowed their most wealthy clients to add it to their portfolios.  Sound familiar? It was some hell of what felt like an endless stream of FUD that they spread on Apple, which as you may know is only the most valuable company in the world today.  They scared my poor immigrant dad who came to this country with nothing and started investing in his youth, out of his Apple stock in the '97 for a small $40k profit with their endless stream of FUD news lies. That news stopped him from ever investing back into the market.  And that stock he was scared into selling would be worth millions today. I can only imagine how many other people they scared out of that stock and others like it, who could have greatly improved their lives with those internet tech stock assets.  Because of that experience, I'm never letting them scare me out of selling my Bitcoin.

So let's say I've  amassed a collective of talented and up and coming artists hell bent on  making the world weirder. Here's what I'm thinking, tell me if this is  stupid.  As part of our cult  initiation program, we put candidates through a crypto literacy program.  Get them setup with wallets, tips on safely storing, and how to get paid for art through crypto . A portion of each transaction  goes into a sort of shared crypto investment account. We use smart contracts to pay out a  percentage of any growth automatically (each participant paid a relative  % based on how much they've put into the pot) when it hits a certain  percentage of growth. Basically like rewards on a credit card, except  there's no limits on number of payouts.  There's  two reasons I like this concept. 1: It sort of mathematically codifies our ethos of  ""We all do better when we all do better"" and 2: It essentially makes us  our own bank without adding any operational overhead.     Idk, crazy? Would bitcoin be the most sensible coin to store the pot in? Could Ethereum 2.0 execute this sort of contract? Is any of this remotely possible?

BillionaireBobby1,Bitcoin,Bitcoin helped me earn money in Nigeria Thank you Bitcoin. The banks in Nigeria dont connect to any internet accounts so it's always a problem to receive fiat money here. The niara is considered monopoly money here. For the last year I've been earning from the internet. Bitcoin is helping me to get by much better than making $1 a day with money most people don't  want to accept! It was helping earn some extra profit but for now its stack until the next bull run.   This is a post for people who are in countries similar to the situation here in Nigeria. Bitcoin can change your life. It has for me. Next time somebody offers you PP or WU ask for them to send Bitcoin. It's faster and easier once your client understands it.   You may get lucky if they already have some tucked away. Then the only problem is getting them to let go of it :P,159,2021-07-19 15:44:20

2358452,Bitcoin,"Lightning Network limitations (the case for PoS update) The lightning network still has severe limitations. The fees are still significant.  To open a channel, the receiver needs a collateral (say, $100). When this collateral is exhausted, you need to commit a transaction to the blockchain. With fees being high, that would still be way too high for day-to-day payments; remember that fees are multiplied by the number of asymmetric hops as well.  In terms of volume, there is still a requirement of about one transaction on the main chain per channel opening, i.e. payment processor setup (per collateral allocation time). Bitcoin supports at most about 400k transactions per day -- if every channel lasts about 1 year (very optimistic), only about 140 million users, **absolute max**, can use Lightning.  Other cryptocurrencies (like Eth) use both Proof of Stake to keep costs low, as well as sharding to enable high scalability of main chain. This means 2nd layer (or even other currencies) integrate well with low fees into the mainnet.  The largest problem with BTC is not this however. It's simply that PoW energy usage is too large. We're using far too much energy, and it's not necessary at all. PoS concerns amount to pretty much FUD (fear, uncertainty doubt) because there are proven PoS chains for a while now (I suspect there were far more attacks on PoW chains than PoS). It's criticized by people that don't understand the self-stability of the system, just like no one really understood how reliable Bitcoin can be at the start. Satoshi and original founders never spoke against PoS -- they simply didn't even consider this could be an option. In light of this PoW doesn't make sense.  As I see it, there are only two options for BTC:  (1) Switch to PoS  (2) Become obsolete  ---  ( (3) is Burn the World. Please don't. )  More info: https://www.investopedia.com/tech/bitcoin-lightning-network-problems/",315,2021-07-19 14:05:05

BadBoyFinance,Bitcoin,"Hey Friends! I made a video on how you can earn a passive income using your bitcoin, check it out if you're interested :) Hey friends! First up, I would like to mention that majority of your bitcoin should be in a cold hardware wallet and NOT in the following methods which will earn you passive income. However, if you would like to earn some passive income using bitcoin/crypto currency and are accepting of the risks - I made a [video](https://youtu.be/WrWIt71vlsU) explaining how to. I always wished to be able to live of my crypto and I have finally reached that point, I hope to be able to help you in your journey as well. If you like to read instead, then I have written a guide here. Nevertheless, please take good care of yourself in this current climate :)   1. Lending Platforms   Lending platforms are lending services that offer deposits and loans on both centralised and decentralised platforms. Essentially, as a crypto holder, you will deposit your crypto onto these platforms and earn an interest on those crypto funds that you deposited. It's pretty similar to how a bank works. These services will hold our crypto and lend it out in order to generate interest  and this interest is then paid back to us on a regular or even daily basis. With most lending platforms, you do not have to deposit your cryptocurrency for a fixed period of time, in fact you have access to your funds at any point in time should you require to utilise your crypto. In addition,  many of these platforms provide insurance to the funds that you deposit making it one of the safest ways to make passive income. To sum it up, the beauty of lending platforms are that they allow your money to compound daily with minimal risk whilst giving you 24/7 access to your crypto funds.     2. Staking Coins (NOT RELEVANT TO BTC)  Coin staking is the action of staking your coins in order to help maintain the decentralised consensus on proof of stake blockchains. It's kind of like being a miner in a POW blockchain such as bitcoin. But in bitcoin - miners compete with their computing power, in proof of stake block chains - people compete with the amount of coins they stake. The more coins one stake, the higher the probability of being chosen to validate a node. When you stake a coin, you earn a a decent return of your coin in kind and you also help to secure the network of the coin you are bullish on. There are a number of things you have to consider:   \- Wallet Support - Staking complexity - Duration of lockup  - Staking returns   Different coins have different staking parameters.     3.Liquidity Mining/Yield Farming   Liquidity mining It is the practice of supplying liquidity to a protocol which is then used in order to facilitate the decentralised exchange of different assets. The transaction fees exchange users pay in exchanging the two coins is then distributed among liquidity providers based on the proportion of liquidity they provide. Some examples of such DEXES are Uniswap and Sushiswap. However, the risk of liquidity mining is impermanent loss. Impermanent loss is the quantified opportunity cost of providing liquidity should one of the tokens become volatile in price.  For Yield Farming I recommend Yearn finance - an app which automates the process by sending your crypto currency to different platforms in order to earn the highest return possible. The risk is that your funds are being moved in yearn vaults and pools may be exploited.",598,2021-07-19 14:02:45

cascading_disruption,Bitcoin,"The good old days: I‚Äôm Kevin and I'm the guy who bought 259684 BTC for $2613 yesterday "" I was watching, like many of you, a gigantic sell order burning through  the bids. Mt Gox doesn't execute trades very quickly, so we were  watching this huge order slowly eat up every buy order on the books. The  price started at around $17.50, and within minutes was below $10. At  this point, I realized this wasn't merely a large seller willing to  accept some losses. This was someone attempting to crash the market by  selling a huge percentage of the market's total bitcoins at once.  I  had around $3000 USD in my Mt Gox account, from earlier sales I'd made.  I looked at the market stats, and realized that there were tons of  orders to buy BTC at $0.01 that would likely eat up any remaining  bitcoins this seller had on the order. I figured if I put a buy order in  for $0.0101, my order would execute first and I could buy a huge amount  of bitcoins from this seller before it hit the bottom. The only problem  was that Mt Gox was running slower than molasses at the time, and  everyone was saying that it wasn't accepting trades. I had to try  several times, but eventually I got a buy order in, offering to buy as  many bitcoins as I could for $0.0101.  The site stopped responding  completely for a while, probably from so many people hitting refresh to  see what was going on. When I got back in, I saw in my account:  06/19/11 17:51¬† Bought BTC¬† 259684.77 for 0.0101  I  had just purchased over 250,000 bitcoins for $2613. At the trading  price immediately before this large sell order happened, that number  would have been worth nearly $5 million. After I regained my breath, I  tried to figure out what to do. I wasn't sure what was really going on.  Over the past few days there had been a lot of talk and complaints about  Mt Gox's security. Lists of Mt Gox usernames, email addresses and  encrypted passwords were being traded around, which was an obvious sign  that security at Mt Gox had been breached in some way. If there was an  attacker in the system, perhaps he was able to log into my account now  and force my account to execute some other crazy trade.

Even if we assume each Bitcoin at $1,000,000 in the next five years, you can DCA as the price may touch $25,000 this year.  So you can get one Bitcoin anywhere between $25,000 and $30,000.

For value, we seek items that have rare properties. meanwhile Satoshi created the scarcest asset known to mankind.  4. Not even one of the largest countries could cripple Bitcoin.   5.

Argentino_Feliz,Bitcoin,"Take a proper care of your mental health. It‚Äôs far more valuable than anything else    I know, another post about the mental health but hear me out, please.  As most of you already know, we‚Äôre living in a society that values money. We will do many things for it and sometimes it may result in sacrificing our mental health. This can be a subversive process that is hard to catch in the moment. The absolute paradox of value and money is that the very thing you chase can be the thing that destroys you. Unfortunately, I have chased money on several occasions and in parallel sacrificed relationships, time and most importantly, my mental health. I've lost sleep, jeopardized relationships and undermined my own ethics far too many times to count. Although my relationship with money has evolved, in my early days I was specifically obsessed about these 3 things:  1. Not having enough 2. My friends doing better than me 3. Others doing better than me  I also started asking these questions:  1. Do I lose sleep over my crypto positions? (Yes) 2. Can I go a day without checking the market? (No) 3. How do I feel when I lose? (Like shit, of course, what did you expect)  I realized I have a big problem. My investing habits were destroying my life. After weeks of thinking I came up with these points to get me back on track:  1. Staying away from social media or at least reducing it by a wide margin 2. Not reading news in the evenings before bed 3. Leaving my phone in another room when I went to sleep. 4. Taking at least 1 full day per week totally away from all screens, phone, laptop, desktop and otherwise and hitting the mountains 5. Trading far less. When I trade less and look at the screen less, I tend to make more money.  Right now, I‚Äôm doing way better and I‚Äôm really thankful for that. I hope some of you might find it useful. Success has nothing to do with how much money you have, it's about the relationship you have with money, people and yourself.

Argentino_Feliz,Bitcoin,"I am 100% convinced of $100k BTC this year    I have Glassnode subscription. I have been following the on chain metrics since the dip in May. I am comparing both on chain and the charts of the current sideways market to previous long bear markets and consolidation markets aka crab market.  At first in May, there was a lot of negative metrics like miners capitulation, whale and retail capitulation.  But since the middle of June, miners are accumulating, whales are accumulating, only retail is mostly selling but also the number of wallets keeps trending up. In long bear markets, this will not happen.  The current situation looks exactly the same as the middle part of 2013 and 2017. Some boring months and then suddenly the mother of all bull runs out of nowhere.  Remember that BTC was 2.5k around June-July in 2017. You wouldn't have believed it would hit 20k by December back then either. 2013 same story with a lot of sideways during middle of the year.  First it was Elon FUD. Then in the last 3 to 4 weeks, Bitcoin has overcome being banned by the world's most populated country. It only made a slight impact on price. Difficulty adjusted and now miners are relocating and coming back online with renewables.  Remember China also banned Bitcoin in the middle of 2017. These attacks never work on Bitcoin. It always makes Bitcoin stronger, so expect a raging bull run to start soon.  Bitcoin history shows that dip buyers have always won. Dip sellers just end up buying at higher price. So take your opportunity or you will regret later.  In 2013, BTC started in 3 figures and reached 4 figures.  In 2017, BTC started in 4 figures and reached 5 figures.  In 2021, BTC started in 5 figures and will reach 6 figures.  It's like clockwork. A mathematical miracle!  Edit : These are my thoughts based on my own research. NFA. DYOR.",323,2021-07-18 20:03:44

rgnet1,Bitcoin,"You hear about Lightning all the time, but did you ever use it? Just do it. It proves bitcoin is already able to be the world's payment network. It's easy to become skeptical of pronouncements about massive new developments that are caveated with ""and the real world applications will get there eventually.""  For example, the Lightning Network as secure off-chain settlement to solve Bitcoin's scaleability. Always sounded reasonable, but many, many years have passed since initial proposals and nothing ever seemed here or stable.  Someone tipped me with lnbot the other day for a comment posted, and I thought as knowledgable as I've been about bitcoin for a long time, I have no idea how to claim something that is legitimately built on the bitcoin network.  So I do a little investigating for a Lightning compatible wallet. Critical for me is:  * open source * non-custodial  Came across the usual lists of recommended wallets and dug deeper into Muun.  I am blown away.  Not only does it meet those two criteria, it's just simple, fast, and does exactly what I didn't think would be possible with LN - it makes it so you *don't have to think about it*.  I click ""Receive"", I click ""Lightning"" and just like any bitcoin transaction, you get a QR code and I withdrew my sats from the lntipbot. That's cool and all but what's important is how can someone get their on-chain bitcoin onto Lightning, so it's ready for its actual use case of buying coffee and whatnot.  I have to set up a channel right? Or find someone to open a channel with? I have to manage how long the channel's open? Invoices? Eh? Bitcoin's simplicity vanishes... but no!  Muun's whole philosophy is you get **one** balance. So I hit ""Receive"", then ""Bitcoin"", then I send like $10 worth to it. Now suddenly, my Muun wallet has a balance of the tip from before and the btc I just sent, no distinction. I don't know what's on chain, off chain, but **it doesn't matter**!   I then hit ""Send"", ""Lightning"" and deposit $5 into the Reddit lntipbot. It works! I definitely didn't have $5 of LN balance, but it sends instantly all the same.  *This is how it's meant to be.* The security, distributed protection, and rigid scarcity of Bitcoin, but versatility to handle microtransactions globally. The only reason bitcoin is not every country's default currency is people's ignorance and the intentional or unintentional misinformation spewed by those with power to lose.   It's worked since 2008. It works even better now. The technology is here. You don't need complex custodial financial constructs like ETFs and derivatives to own it as an investment and you don't need 1,000s of other pointless cryptos to use it for small payments. Try Muun or some other Lightning wallet and start using it. This just feels game changing, and it shouldn't have taken me getting a Reddit tip to figure that out.",493,2021-07-18 19:41:08

Xmrtrader0101,Bitcoin,"Are we in an Echo Chamber here? Are we ignoring what is right in front of us? I've been lurking this sub daily since February when I first became interested in actually investing in BTC long term (I did speculation trading in 2017...sold 3 BTC at below 3k). Anyways, I purchased $800 or so dollars worth the week before the steep price drop began to occur this yeat. I've DCA'd down to average it out but there are many more variables now, it seems, than there were in February that seem to be mentioned but their impacts ignored:  -Chinese ban..this time it looks like for good. They want their own centralized controlled digital currency to coexist and eventually take over the yuan. I have graduate degrees in Chinese Political Economy and there was NO WAY BTC was going to be allowed to thrive there. Mining for a time; Yes. It benefited the central government. When the population gets involved and starts gaining interest in obtaining and using a currency they have (the possibility) of no control over-it's game over for BTC in the PRC.   -The US issuing it's own coin (USDT if I remember correctly), tied tot he US dollar with very little variation from it. Maybe 0.01 on a bad day.   -Bukele in El Salvador will simply use the infrastructure of BTC to make their own state-controlled coin, just like the United States and China. I see comments here like ""the IMF got to him,"" or that ""he bowed down to international pressure."" No, he simply 1) will now will have a currency in which is controlled by the central government, which power resides primarily in Bukele. 2) I wonder who is going to own the exchanges and wallets that the coin works through? You all are rooting for a Trump-like populist figure. Many of you want to be long-term thinkers when it comes to the advancement of the abolishment of FIAT but willing to skip the steps necessary for the dream to come true. Look at examples of the 20th century and ""skipping steps"" and you'll notice a trend. It didn't work.   -So called ""whales"" and accounts that control the most BTC, especially exchanges and now major banks control the most BTC at the moment. Only a finite amount of BTC can ever be mined. There is ALREADY a wealth disparity occurring. You think the BTC millionaires/billionaires who held since 2009/11 are here en-masse posting? I think I read a figure here that the average BTC ""HODLER"" here has about $1000 invested. Those who purchased in 2009-2017 are set. They can sell all their BTC now and make enormous profits. Newcomers, not so much, hence your interest in posting here. You have an interest, a need, for the price to go up in order to reclaim your FIAT investment, disavowing the point of BTC in general.  -Many on this site aren't even necessarily concerned with BTC's current ties to USD. That you believe in the political and financial statement BTC is trying to make. That's good, and honestly I agree with you folks. I so very much that dream would come through. But at the current rate I forecast it's just not happening.   From my undergraduate and graduate degrees in relevant fields, I will tell you that governments WILL NOT ALLOW A CURRENCY TO BE DECENTRALIZED AND OUT OF THEIR CONTROL. They will shove FUD so far up your sphincter or put regulations in place (that benefit the wealthy and hurt the middle and lower classes) that that it comes out of your mouth. When the price dropped in February and March, all I read was ""HODL, HODL, HODL,"" though I don't quite see that anymore. People get excited if BTC maintains $34k for a day at this point in time.   -This is all just my opinion and my own speculation that I've noticed and recognized from the past, both in dealing with BTC and in dealing with a major change in currencies. I think some more members of this sub should perhaps think about other sides of the coin and reevaluate your position on BTC, or atleast take a step back and become unattached for a moment to see the possible realities ahhead.       - I'm by no means an expert. Hell, I HOPE BTC hits 50, 100k by the end the year or so as I am holding a certain amount in cold storage, but I also am not blind to the realities surrounding it. My belief is BTC will not see a demand that warrants a 100k price point, The FUD I mentioned will be too great. FOX and CNN will deem BTC ""Buying the Crack"" or some stupid shit like that. Just, please, at the moment be smart, only invest in what you can REALLY afford to lose, and look at the variables presented right in front of you. States take action to increase power and wealth, and BTC goes against that, I think the world economy & states involved in that economy are a great deal stronger than a single Cryptocurrency.  PS: Due to work and family I probably won‚Äôt respond to posts, at least for awhile. Feel free to rip it apart and posts your opinions- I think that this is what this sub is all about; hopefully in a respectful manner and discussion.",891,2021-07-18 17:57:43

Disclaimer: I am not encouraging any other currency and trying to adhere to the group rules as much as I can. This question is purely as a discussion of how Bitcoin can prove to be better than what it is today and that‚Äôs it.  I think that if BTC mining process follows a first-seen-first-safe transaction mechanism with 0-conf, the transaction fee and waiting times can be brought down significantly than what it is today. 0-conf alone is dangerous but think if your payment becomes irreversible then you need not rely on confirmation if you make a payment to a merchant and that payment will become instantaneous (which will be confirmed at a later point of time, but due to irreversibility, is a hundred percent reliable payment with negligible chances of double spending).

foxy-agent,Bitcoin,"Is 10 minutes really that bad? I was a member of an online/ app-based bank for 5 years. I loved them! Then they were bought out by a new bank and the old bank accounts were converted over and the old app was EOL‚Äôed. The new (X) bank and their app sucks (IMO), so I decided to switch to a different (Y) bank. I opened up an account with said different (Y) bank at the beginning of the month. A week later I started the transfer. X bank is headquartered in Alabama, and Y bank is HQ‚Äôed in Michigan. I thought transferring my money would be easy, but immediately I had problems. Bank X had a $10,000/day limit to ACH push money to an external bank, but luckily Y bank has no limit to ACH pull money into my account.  On a Friday morning at 10am I tried to initiate a transfer of my funds from X to Y, but I could not select the current Friday to initiate the transfer. I had to choose the following Monday to initiate the transfer! On Monday the funds disappeared from my X bank account and I received confirmation of the funds in my Y bank on the next Thursday.

I realize waiting 10, 20, or 30 minutes to get into the next few blocks can be frustrating, and people bemoan their transactions taking so long when we just want to click a button and have instant confirmation.

TomEltonArt,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin: Longest Chain AND Outpacing the Attackers I have been rereading through Nakamoto‚Äôs white paper again. My focus for now is on the abstract. (I am also rereading to see if Nakamoto ever mentions ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù or how the concept is developed in the paper.) I have rolled my sleeves up several times in working to get my head around Bitcoin and crypto in general. It struck me this morning as I was reading that it isn‚Äôt just the outpacing of the attackers, but the other security mechanism is the length of the chain in the cooperative nodes.  I am working on trying to create an accurate visual portrait of Bitcoin by breaking it up into its smaller systems. As I read and think through the currency I get a mental image from the various concepts, and I try to capture them while I can see it in my mind‚Äôs eye. Hopefully I will be able to sew all the elements together into a coherent portrait at some point.

Odbdb,Bitcoin,"Is this true? Can it be debunked? Saw this in another sub. Would like to hear some truth about it:    Core has rigged the game the same way legacy has.  By instituting a fee market with the blocksize cap they have effectively gamed the network to be a positive feedback loop.  1.	‚Å†‚Å†create fee market (institute blocksize cap, had nothing to do with tech capabilities really) 2.	‚Å†‚Å†fee market creates competition for transactions thus increasing the price of fees 3.	‚Å†‚Å†higher fees ensures hashpower on desired chain 4.	‚Å†‚Å†higher hashpower = more security. investors will always choose highest security to store value (hence the store of value narrative and the HODL narrative that decreases liquidity) 5.	‚Å†‚Å†more money flows into Core chain and causes fees to scale up with it therefore creating the positive feedback loop of rising fees and investment.  If you follow this logic to its end it will cause Core chain to become so expensive to spend on that only the largest institutions (governments and central banks) capable of using it. Sound familiar right? Then another transactional layer (FEDcoin, LN is a red herring) instituted for plebs to use that will be fully transparent and controllable (if you aren't using your money in an approved manner you are disciplined like Chinas Sesame Credit) by the USG and any other entity that has the access.  Edit: I should also mention that I have a suspicion that the Chinese miners were spamming the network to force legit transaction to carry fees. This would mean the miners are incentivized to not act in the best interest of the network as a whole so all of the Core model is fundamentally broken by the fee market.",285,2021-07-18 16:11:18

Adventurous-Ant-7696,Bitcoin,"A question I have to ask: Are we witness that Josph Schumpert's idea of ‚Äúcreative destruction‚Äù is valid and so blockchain technology makes our traditional banking system obsolete?     A name that should not be missing when we talk about today's finance world is Joseph Schumpert, who was through and through fascist. He shaped many generations of economists, bankers and related investment strategies. One often hears the name Karl Marx or Adam Smith, but for the conservative financial world, Schumpert's main work, which is based on Marx's ideas, ""Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy"" (first published in 1942) laid one of the cornerstones of today's financial world, with the crazy idea of ‚Äú‚Äã‚Äãcreative destruction‚Äù ‚Äì  a process of industrial mutation that continuously revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. The book is much more than a prognosis of capitalism‚Äôs future. It is also an overambitious defense of capitalism on the grounds that capitalism sparks entrepreneurship. It is the third most cited book in the social sciences published before 1950, behind Marx's Capital and The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith. Currently, on google scholar, he is top 4 of cited economic researcher.  Even Schumpert was a crazy bastard in his ideas about how capitalism is and should be organised in our society, he believed that capitalism would be destroyed by its successes, as he starts in his prologue ‚ÄúCan capitalism survive? No. I do not think it can. ""  To come back to the crypto world, my question is: Will and can blockchain technology change our economic system, to a fair spread of wealth in this world, or to fetch and carry capitalism as we have it now?

Realistic_Station_89,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Is The Future    I'll share a brief story for my readers so that they can learn from it and not make the same mistakes that I almost made, which I feel is the single biggest risk in crypto. I recently got a new phone, and of course, traded my old phone in for 100 bucks or whatever they gave me. What I didn't realize is that my 2-factor authentication was tied to the old phone, so when I went to log into my BlockFi account after having a couple of glasses of wine, I couldn't get into my account. I tried the Google Authenticator with the new phone and my Google account, but Google gave me an error message when I did that. I had to use the recovery key that they gave me when I set up my account. I'm in. No big deal, right? Before it logs me in, something pops up with another recovery key, which I can't really tell if it's the same or not. I take a picture of it to be safe. The next time I log into my account, I realize that the old recovery key did not work and that me taking a picture may have been the only thing that saved me from losing all of my crypto. I withdrew all of my crypto from BlockFi after this and put it in the exchange-traded Grayscale Trust  at a discount to NAV to avoid becoming a statistic.  I don't know for sure whether I would have been able to get my crypto back or not. I've had friends lose hundreds of thousands of dollars of crypto by losing their keys to it. There's a guy in the UK [who accidentally threw out](https://www.thecryptocapital.com) over $250 million in Bitcoin. *The New York Times* [profiled a programmer](https://thecryptocapital.com) in San Francisco who lost over $200 million in Bitcoin as well. In the second case, the guy simply doesn't remember the password. There are two sides to this argument, the first that when other people lose the keys to their currency that it benefits everyone else, and the second is that if it could happen to you it's a ridiculous risk. In the end, maybe the biggest risk of investing in Bitcoin isn't that the price crashes, but that something happens to you or you forget your password and lose all your money into cyberspace. If anyone here has lost Bitcoin and is willing to share, please share your story in the comments, I believe my readers would benefit from your experience!",426,2021-07-18 13:56:14

At the time of writing, I basically have bitcoin risk free as the initial investment has been taken out of the markets, plus profits, now I just got a bank loan (roughly $25k) which I'll pay in 5 years at 6.8% interest rate. I figured, I'll have this BTC on blockfi getting ~5-6% and getting more BTC with very low risk, if BTC goes south, I have enough money to pay back the loan and liquidate my position.

1entreprenewer,Bitcoin,"Does the difficulty adjustment pro-rate corrections? Hi all, Given the recent difficulty rate adjustment, I realized I didn‚Äôt quite understand something. It will be hard to articulate, but here it goes.   When the difficulty rate adjustment happens, does it compensate for the previous periods slow or fast blocks?  For example, if for 2 weeks we are solving blocks only every 20 minutes, then we are behind schedule 50% on blocks (extreme example). Does the difficulty adjustment factor this in, and set us up with a new schedule that will bring us to where we SHOULD have been? Or does it just shoot for 10 minute blocks, and hope that the behind schedule periods and the ahead of schedule periods even out?  Part of my concern in asking is because we almost always, until recently, see difficulty adjustments increase‚Ä¶ meaning that without a prorated correction mechanism, we would consistently be ahead of schedule‚Ä¶.?  I suppose I could do the math and figure it out for myself, but I wanted to see if anyone knows.",173,2021-07-18 05:07:23

ShotBot,Bitcoin,"About Jack Dorsey building a Bitcoin ""defi"" platform. How would it work? Is it competition for Ethereum?    Bitcoin doesn't have ERC20 tokens or a programming language like Solidity, so the backend isn't going to be the same as ETH defi. However, I do believe you can create decentralized financial applications for bitcoin that on the frontend function the same for the users as ETH defi. It's going to be engineered with a different design philosophy and more centralized/decentralized in some areas, but accomplish the same goal for the user.  As we know, the weak point of Ethereum right now is the network fees, and I think Jack Dorsey is trying to hit Ethereum where it hurts. With the lightning network bitcoin fees are reduced to near 0. Another weak point for Ethereum Defi is user interface. If Jack Dorsey can build a platform with a more friendly and easy user experience, I could imagine Bitcoin Defi stealing some of Ethereum's thunder.",161,2021-07-17 22:05:11

New_start_new_life,Bitcoin,"Noob question - detection of 51% hack - how can it go undetected if the hash of last block has changed? If someone is able to attain 50% control over compute power of network, that party can supposedly change past transactions by ""remining"" all old blocks that succeed an even older block where a target transaction was changed by our bad actor. And that bad actor can stay undetected at least for some time. But.....  If s/he changes that old transaction, *and* then is able to find right hash for the new block before everyone else, *and* can then ""force"" a consensus on the network (because s/he controls 50% of compute power) the fraud will *still be plain obvious* to a minority of ""behaving"" nodes on the network.   Because by the very nature of SHA256 algorithm, the hash of the last block in the chain (before the above 51% attack took place) will have suddenly changed too.    Doesn't that make the 51% attack detectable *immediately* upon occurrence? Where am I going wrong?",172,2021-07-17 20:07:15

charleyeeee,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Maxi Needing Some Help So as the title states, I am looking for the options of you all to help me in this situation.   I (27M) have been a Bitcoin maximalist for quite some time and I feel like I truly understand the value Bitcoin and and will continue to play in our world. I feel so strongly about Bitcoin, because I have put in so much time and effort through the years learning.   Recently, my sister (23F) came to me asking for some assistance with investing her money. She has been stacking cash and has created a great nest egg to get her started thanks to her efforts of working hard and saving.   To give a bit of background. Our father is a financial advisor and because I have always took an interest in it, we have always spoke about it and I have learned a lot through him. My sister was never really interested or seemed to care. All she wanted was the cash sitting in her shoebox. With everything going on my dad and I speak about BTC alot.. like to the point my sister gets annoyed about it.   We truly believe it is the best place to put your cash long term for the future with the best returns with the least risk.. opportunity cost.   I asked what she was thinking about investing in or how I could help. She responded with, well I'm not really sure where to start. I gave her some response to the idea that Bitcoin would be the simplest, quickest, and best way for her to allow for her money to appreciate. She of course is very turned aways by that idea because she has never cared to actually learn what Bitcoin is and it's value.   She stated that she has been watching lots of TikTok videos on how she could buy house/real estate to do Airbnb because it's so easy and she says she can live off the income. I am unaware of her true knowledge in this area and feel like she is just getting the very bare basic information on how easy it is, but she has not thought about all the time, energy and efforts she would have with going through the real life process. In addition she is still having to pay for her own rent, which counteracts what she would be having to spend for the mortgage, fees, insurance, taxes, etc. In hopes that she would make a % difference from her costs and what she would make renting through Airbnb. In addition, her money is not liquid at all and she is taking on more unnecessary debt for the chance to make some profits with the uncertainty of the property decreasing/increasing in value.  Overall, I am unsure how I should go forward with this conversation. I would like to help her, but how would I best go about that? Our father always told us, invest in what you know and what you enjoy learning about. She has no interest in learning about Bitcoin at all, even though I believe it will be bigger than what the internet is today. I want her to think about her future and how she wants to spend her time, energy, and efforts. But, in the end, we all don't know what we don't know.   Any thoughts, opinions, or advice on how to approach this situation?   If you have any questions, I left out anything or you need additional info, please ask.",584,2021-07-17 17:24:51

In a 9 pages PDF document they describe how Bitcoin works, and what makes it special and important to all of us.¬†  I will not cover every detail of the so-called Whitepaper, but I will try to explain Bitcoins most important features.¬†  Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.¬†  Let us start with that. Everyone of you knows what cash is. Some of us still use it on a daily basis to purchase goods and services. We use coins and bills. Once we give our cash to someone, this cash is not in our possession anymore, and we can not give the same bills or coins to someone else. So far so good. If one person gives cash to another person, you could call it peer to peer. One peer gives cash to the other peer. Simple like that. There is no need for someone in between, a middleman, or a bank, to verify the peer to peer cash transfer from one person to another.¬†  And Bitcoin in its core is exactly this, just electronic. You can send (or transfer) Bitcoin from one person to another, just like cash. And the best is, you don‚Äôt need a middleman, for example a bank, or a company like PayPal or Visa, in order to do so. That you can do this peer to peer, electronically, is maybe the biggest and most important feature of Bitcoin. It also makes Bitcoin resistant and resilient. You don‚Äôt have to trust anyone to store your Bitcoin or run the Bitcoin network. This is one of the reasons it is often called trust-less. As there is no central authority controlling Bitcoin, Bitcoin can‚Äôt be shut down. The only way for Bitcoin to disappear is, if everyone that is running Bitcoin needs to be convinced to stop doing this. As of today, we are talking about tens of thousands of computers and companies all over the world. Together they create the decentralized peer to peer Bitcoin network. The only way to shut down Bitcoin, is to shut down the internet. And this is very unlikely to happen, especially when we are entering a time where the internet can be accessed via satellites from every corner of the earth.¬†  Access is also a very important topic for Bitcoin. As explained before the Bitcoin network is a decentralized peer to peer network without a central authority or middlemen. Everything is public at any time, every transaction, every address (often called a wallet or identity) that is used to send or receive Bitcoin. Even more important is that everyone can participate in Bitcoin without asking for permission. Think about it like a public park, everyone can enter, you don‚Äôt need to ask anyone to do so. This is why Bitcoin is also called public and permission-less. Bitcoin is for everyone, the only thing you need is an internet connection and a smartphone or computer.  The easiest way to get started with Bitcoin is getting a Bitcoin wallet. It‚Äôs like your physical wallet in your pocket, just as an app, on your smartphone or computer. Once installed, you will receive an address, and a key, usually 12-24 English words. The key is like your password, only you know it, and only with the key you can access your Bitcoin. If you lose your key, you lose your Bitcoin. If someone gets to know your key, this person can access your Bitcoin. Therefore it is advised to store the key in a very safe place and never show it to anyone. Think about it like the key to your physical Tresor. So protect it well!  You can create as many addresses as you want, it is completely free, public and permission-less, for everyone in the world, no matter if your government allow it or not, Bitcoin is literally for everyone, no one is or can be excluded, like you can‚Äôt be excluded from receiving cash from someone who stands in front of you and giving you it.¬†  If only you have the key to your wallet, you become your own bank.¬†  You have full control and ownership of your Bitcoin and no one can ever access them without your consent, or better said, without your key. If you die and don't pass the key to someone, your Bitcoin will be lost forever. Bitcoin gives you strong control and ownership but it comes hand in hand with being self responsible. There is no way to recover your Bitcoin once your key is lost or your Bitcoin has been sent to a different address.¬†  This sounds scary, but it is a very important feature of Bitcoin. Also the fact that Bitcoin transfers are non-reversible, you can‚Äôt get them back, or call someone, once sent (remember: there are no middlemen, Bitcoin is peer to peer). The fact that you can‚Äôt take back Bitcoin you sent so someone also ensures that you can‚Äôt send the same Bitcoin to multiple people. Again, think about cash. If you pass a bill to someone, you are not in possession of that bill anymore. You can not double spend it. Bitcoin can also not be double-spent. If you received it and if you own the key to your wallet, those Bitcoins are solely accessible and owned by you and not by anyone else.¬†  Bitcoin is private. No one knows who owns which address. This is why addresses are often called identities. If you want, you can create a new identity for every single transaction. You can, but you don‚Äôt have to re-use an address. This makes Bitcoin very private. If ten different people want to send you Bitcoin, you can give every single person a different address. This is how you stay anonymous and private. As Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt require any registration with your real name or passport, there is no connection to you in real life. This is one of the reasons why platforms like Wikileaks accept donations in Bitcoin, or why the dark web is using it too. Bitcoin is like cash. If you give someone cash on the street, both of you don‚Äôt have to know each other and you can still make a transaction.  But of course there is much more. First of all, there are only ever 21 Million Bitcoin in existence. Every Bitcoin can be divided into one hundred million pieces, the smallest piece of one Bitcoin is called a satoshi. One satoshi is 1/100.000.000 of a Bitcoin. To compare it with USD, one USD can be divided in 100 US cents. So 1 cent is 1/100 of a USD.  But other than USD or Euro, Bitcoin can not be created out of thin air, the total amount is fixed to 21 Million.¬†  So how can you get Bitcoin?¬†  Bitcoin can be earned by securing and running the Bitcoin network. As this part is quite technical and difficult, I will not explain it in this video.¬†  An easier way to own Bitcoin, is to exchange Bitcoin with another currency, or buy Bitcoin from someone, or get paid in Bitcoin for work, instead of getting paid in Euro for example. You can exchange Bitcoin for Euro or USD or any other currency, the same way you can exchange USD for GBP for example.¬†  Why does Bitcoin have value?  To be honest, before Bitcoin I never thought about the question why money has a specific value. I had no idea where it came from (the state? The government?) and I didn‚Äôt really care. But with more and more people calling Bitcoin an alternative to traditional cash, I became interested to learn more about it.¬†  You could say, the value of a product is defined by its importance of utility. Meaning, if a product is very useful (can be used for many things) it‚Äôs worth a lot. But that argument doesn‚Äôt hold. Life could not exist without water, but water seems to be less expensive than diamonds.¬†  Scarcity is important too. Scarcity (how many diamonds exist and how many people want them) is an important factor. Let it be a bottle of wine or a Picass√¥ painting. Marx once said, the value derived from the labour used to produce it. Growing a tomato is easier than growing a cow, so cow meat is more expensive than tomatoes.¬†  But all this didn‚Äôt really explain to me the value of Bitcoin, so I looked into the USD. The name Dollar was derived from a place that produced the first silver coins, a valley that was called Joachims-thal, the coin was called Thaler, throughout the time Thaler became Dollar. So there we go. First dollars were silver coins.¬†  With the introduction of the dollar more than 200 years ago, the dollar was basically a certificate for gold. At any time you could go to the bank (or government), give them your dollar and receive your gold. Gold was scarce back then and is scarce today. It has a high scarcity, and there is nothing more scarce than Bitcoin today (think about it, there are only ever 21 million Bitcoin!).¬†  Back to the topic. Good money (how Austrian economics called it) can not come from thin air. Why does anyone like Pablo Picasso‚Äôs paintings? And pays a certain amount of USD or Bitcoin for it. Nobody knows and it doesn‚Äôt matter. Bitcoin can easily be money. Scarcity is important, and it‚Äôs very difficult to find anything scarcer than Bitcoin.  Today, the Dollar and the Euro and basically all government issued currencies are centrally planned and controlled. At any time, governments can create money out of thin air. And there is nothing we do about it. We need money to pay for goods and services, and when the government needs money, for example to fight a pandemic, they create money.¬†  This leads to problems though. Money needs to be in balance. There can‚Äôt be free money, or everyone would take as much as they want and money would become totally worthless. Hyperinflation would start.¬†  One person that received the Nobel prize in 1974 for economics is Hayek. He described the value of money in time. There are two types of people, he said, one type that has money, one type that needs money. Someone who has a very high time preference, needs money at this very moment, to buy champagne in the club or to start a business. These people usually borrow that money from someone who has a low time preference, someone who has saved money, usually through banks. The interest they ask for is the balance between these two parties. For what percentage are you willing to lend me money? This is what Hayek received the Nobel prize for. The natural rate of interest is the balance between low and high time preferences.¬†  Today money is completely out of hand. You can borrow it for free from the bank, and there is no limit. Other than in Bitcoin, there is an unlimited number of dollars (or other fiat currencies) and this number grows at an incredible increasing speed.¬†    https://preview.redd.it/57xrjp8lyrb71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0a399b603f8ee1bbded77a76eb6684a4183088c  We have the problem that governments create money. Nearly 80% of all USD ever created, have been created in less then one and a half year. 4000 billion (21%) in 229 years, 19.200 (100%) billion dollars, 79% in the last 16 month years (Jan2020-May2021).¬†  Bitcoin is really difficult to imagine. Inflation too. We trust central authorities to not cause inflation. Bitcoin has no central authority and its supply is clearly limited and known in advance.  No more people, at any point in the history of the world, have thought about what money is. Or how central banks work, or how money is created.¬†  I don‚Äôt see the existence of fiat money and central banks as unchangeable. Bitcoin was able to educate more people on economics than any book. And we are just getting started.¬†  Bitcoin is good money. Accessible through a public and permission-less peer-to-peer network for every single person in the world. Become a Bitcoiner, continue to educate yourself, speak to others and ask questions. I promise you that you won‚Äôt regret it.

The fat cats can simply then impose a 3% tax on all bitcoin held wealth per year, and recoup precisely the same income as with money printing.

jinxedit,Bitcoin,"Wondering about opening wallets across different programs? Hi, I am not very tech savvy but I have some Bitcoin. I've had a few different wallets over the years.  Well, I want to finally get organized. I decided to just open everything using my seeds on Wasabi. Most of these were wallets I initially created and used using Electrum. So it looks like I have all my wallets recovered, and they all seem to be zeroed out except one.  That seems right to me, I'm pretty sure I moved everything into the one wallet, but I'm wondering if there's any other steps I should take to make sure I am seeing the right balance. If I just entered the seed correctly and it came up with a wallet, that's correct, right? There's nothing else I need to do?  I want to just stop using all the older wallets and get rid of the seeds connected to them, which I have written on paper copies that are currently just cluttering up my desk. Just wondering if there's anything else I have to do to make sure I am checking my balances accurately before retiring these wallets for good.

If the hash rate has increased 10x then the security has also increased 10x which means one confirmation should be as secure as six confirmations used to be.

billy-gage,Bitcoin,"New investment opportunity in bitcoins     Currently, the use of Bitcoin has spread worldwide, and it can be said that in every country in the world there are people mining this famous cryptocurrency. However, there are countries where Bitcoin is more widely used, so much so that there are companies, businesses and even ATMs to carry out transactions with this cryptocurrency. Being a currency not issued or controlled by central banks and the international banking system in general, they have been developing a campaign by all possible means with the aim of discrediting and the use of cryptocurrencies, and all because I use cryptocurrency releases those who use it from the control of banks and governments.  The operations carried out using the block chain cannot be monitored or controlled by any specific person or organization since it is a completely decentralized system. Some governments in the updated are trying without success to control the income that their citizens obtain in these currencies. Some even, like the Venezuelan government, tried unsuccessfully to create their own currency, which of course no one trusted or will ever trust. In the United States, for example, they have tried to issue regulations that force their citizens to declare their income in cryptocurrencies, since technically governments have no way of finding out this information as if it happens with their banking information.   What is true is that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and it is indisputable that, in the near future, despite the war against them by banks and governments, their use will become more and more widespread due to the fact that each time more people are gaining confidence in them. In the race of some to get hold of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies, many entrepreneurs, let's call it that, with knowledge in the world of computing, and of cryptocurrencies in general, have developed several strategies, the first and best known of which is bitcoin mining. which requires a strong investment in Hardware and is increasingly less profitable for reasons that I will not explain now. Another way to get bitcoins is simply by buying them from a friend or on an online platform that currently exists for these purposes. Another way is by trading cryptocurrencies, which consists of obtaining profits through the prediction of the price fluctuations of the different cryptocurrencies. This last way of earning cryptocurrencies requires a certain level of knowledge to perform this activity because otherwise the money used for trading operations will surely be lost. Another way and it is the one that interests us now and that can be used by anyone is making investments in sites that are dedicated to attracting micro investments with the aim of carrying out large-scale trading and / or short-term financial investments in the currency market.  The creators of these sites are teams of people who have acquired experience and knowledge in the field of finance, trading operations, and computing and cryptocurrencies in general, allowing many micro-investments to generate large amounts of capital to generate profits. which are systematically distributed among the micro investors. Sites like these are the famous Trust Investing that generates so much controversy regarding its legality and whether it is a scam, a Ponzi scheme or not. One thing is true, people invest in this site and make a profit, beyond the fact that they may not be legally well supported, which is very well understood if we remember that governments and banks systematically campaign to smear everything anything that has to do with cryptocurrencies.   Many allege that companies such as Trust Investing are not officially registered in any specific country and if they are, it is not possible to locate their offices or representatives. But the explanation for that does not have so much to do with the business being a scam as it is the option they have as protection against actions of banking institutions and governments that are not very friendly with these types of companies. The most obvious case of this is what happened in Cuba, where one of the most recognized members of Trust Investing was arrested by government authorities on charges of illicit enrichment. In the case of Cuba, many Cubans use these platforms as a means of obtaining income that cannot be controlled or confiscated by the government that systematically works to ensure that the population remains in poverty. It is estimated that at present more than 300,000 Cubans have inerted in Trust Investing and it is generally recognized if they have received significant gains that have influenced the improvement of their living conditions.  Trust Investing is one of the most recognized sites to invest in cryptocurrencies but there are others such as Mind Capital, Mirror Trading, Arbistar, X-Toro. Personally, the writer knows of people who invest in Trust Investing and X-Toro and until now they continue to make profits. Another site that began operating since 2020 is PIETRAVERDI, which is where I am registered and so far I am doing well as well as other people I know. The site is currently officially registered in Costa Rica. I have always considered the possibility that one day the site will stop operating as can happen with any of the other sites that have been operating for several years, but by that time I will have recovered the investment I have made and thus I will not have lost anything and the most possible thing is that in fact I have already earned much more than I invested. The principle of investing in these sites is never to invest in anything that we are not willing to lose. In my case, I invested as little as possible at the beginning, which is what I always recommend. In this case in PIETRAVERDI it is 25 dollars in bitcoins, because this particular site operates only in this currency. PIETRAVERDI pays 24% per month on the amount invested, which is 1.2% daily from Monday to Friday, fixed. 300% of each package invested will be recovered. This means that if $ 25 is invested, the site will pay up to $ 75 for that investment package. The amount is recovered faster through the referral system, since for each new referral captured, the site pays the person who captured it 10% of their investment, that is, if a referral enters and on a given day buys a package of 25 dollars the one who brought it to the site will add to his recovery amount of that day of 1.2% of the package invested the 2.5 dollars corresponding to 10% of the package purchased by his referral. An important element is that registering on the site can only be done through a referral link from someone who is already registered on the site.  PIETRAVERDI also offers the possibility of recovering the investment even faster through the binary network system that consists of building a network of referrals that in turn bring more referrals, dividing the network into two parts hierarchically located below each new user who enters. to the site, so that each new user will be able to have a direct user from each side of the network underneath in the network scheme, the network being successively divided into two for each new user. The earnings per binary network will be 6% of the leg that has the least accumulated points for that day on a given day. The points are equal to the amount invested in a package, if you buy a package of 25 dollars it will be 25 points. It is therefore important not only to attract new referrals that in turn bring new referrals to expand the network more and more, but it is also important to distribute the new referrals so that the two legs of the network are balanced, since the profits 6% will be calculated, as I mentioned before, on a given day of the leg that has the fewest points on that day. Earnings from direct referrals and binary network add to the investment amount recovered and once the investment amount has been recovered, it must be invested in a new package to continue earning. Always for each package 300% will be recovered. It is possible to buy several packages and for each one, the daily 1.2 will be recovered from Monday to Friday and only one of them will be added the amount earned by direct referrals and by binary network, once 300% of a package has been recovered what was earned by referrals Direct and binary network will go to the next purchased package, if you do not buy a new package you will not be able to earn money through binary network or direct referrals and of course no interest. In addition, the maximum amount to earn daily for 1.2% plus 10% of direct referrals, plus 6% of binary network will not exceed the amount of the largest package purchased. This must be taken into account because there are users who have a very large binary network and the daily earnings are therefore significant and can reach hundreds of dollars a day, in the best cases, so it is very important to monitor their behavior and growth. of the network so that it grows in a balanced way on both legs and that the daily amount of earnings never exceeds the amount of the largest package invested because it will be losing money.  To make the first extraction from the site, which will always be to a bitcoin wallet, it will only be necessary to have a minimum of 25 dollars accumulated. I decided to invest in this site for several reasons, the first because it was highly recommended to me by people I trust and with foolproof decency. The second thing is that the site has only been running since the beginning of 2020 and these sites usually, in case of being a scam, last a few years, that is, the sites that arise with the ultimate objective of scamming their users accumulate money for a few years. 5 or 6 years, maybe more and suddenly one day they stop operating, although sometimes they start presenting problems with payment or technical problems on the site. Trust Investing, for example, has been operating for quite some time, I am not sure of the number of years, but it still pays its investors, according to some I know who invest there. In addition, after entering PIETRAVERDI the impression I have is that everything is very well organized and so far it has not stopped paying what they promise, although it has not been a long time, so the earnings are not significant yet, although other users who They entered before and they already have a more developed binary network if they have started to earn more. Finally, another aspect that I left for the end, although it is not the least important, is that normally platforms of this type are usually very sensitive to abrupt variations in the price of cryptocurrencies, even Trust Investing itself had some problems for some time during the recent fall of bitcoin, although afterwards it has continued to operate. However, PIETRAVERDI was operating normally at all times. If after reading all of the above some interest has been aroused in taking the test of investing in this new world of cryptocurrencies and you want to do it through PIETRAVERDI, you can do it through my referral link that I share below, but before you Here are some instructions that you should read well and follow to the letter:   INITIAL REQUIREMENTS TO REGISTER PROPERLY IN PIETRAVERDI:  A) The email with which you register must always be from GMAIL. (This is very important, do not use Yahoo, Hotmail, etc).  B) Always use the PIETRAVERDI website in Portuguese, do not translate it into Spanish or English.  C) Check 5 times that your GMAIL email is well written, without fingerprints, or errors and without blank spaces before or after the field where you wrote it. If your email has an error and you start investing, it will be impossible for you to get your money out of PIETRAVERDI for security reasons. It is not possible to change the email once a user account has been created. After reading and understanding the initial mandatory requirements, you can proceed to create your username through the following link:  [https://office.pietraverdi.com/rafael77](https://office.pietraverdi.com/rafael77)  The data requested during the registration process must be the real ones, name and surname, etc.  Any questions during the process get in touch with your sponsor, that is, me in this case. Once registered, they will be able to share their own referral link to new potential investors to build their own referral network. Remember that the objective of the binary network is to attract referrals who are willing to invest, even if it is in a minimum package initially, because if a new user registers and does not invest, it is never a place in your network that will be occupied for pleasure. If a new referral invests in a minimal initial package later, they will invest more, once they are convinced that the site works and is reliable. After registering and when you decide to buy your first package, which I recommend that the first time is always the minimum, verify that when you create the user account in PIETRAVERDI, an email reaches the Gmail account that you used to register. If the email does not reach you, the registration was incorrect and you should not under any circumstances buy any investment package using that account.  To buy an investment package, you must first have a fund in bitcoins to be able to transfer bitcoins and buy the package. Remember that in bitcoin operations it is necessary to pay a transaction cost in addition to the amount to be transferred, that in some wallets it is necessary to calculate the total to be transferred by adding the amount to be transferred plus the transaction cost and in others the same It calculates the cost of the transaction separately so that you are always sure that the amount you want to transfer in bitcoins is the one that will reach the person who is transferring it.   That said, let's move on to the operations that must be done within the PIETRAVERDI platform to buy the first package. For the purchase of PIETRAVERDI packages it is recommended to access the site through a personal computer or Laptop, since it is an easier interaction process to do the operation, it can be done through a telephone, but obviously it raises a greater difficulty. First, you access the menu called Contracts that is located in the upper left part of your user's BackOffice, once you access this option, the following is displayed:   https://preview.redd.it/2m9fkttolnb71.jpg?width=551&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea9915fa347f93fc36b4e431f73c3a282854563d  Here it is selected, as it is the first time that a package is purchased, the minimum is 25 dollars, once selected, click on New Plan. At the bottom of the screen a new contract will be added that in status puts in open or pending. At this moment you click on the yellow button that says bitcoin that is below on the right:  https://preview.redd.it/xgdxy2hzlnb71.jpg?width=589&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2feea860842f2313a4991ef7e75db93c04dc14e9  If the site was accessed through a PC, a new window will open in the browser, displaying the following information. The following information will be displayed:  https://preview.redd.it/4pja0ya5mnb71.jpg?width=589&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0f5169959f9087d4ac1be171a3ae8fe2b86c350  At this time, the available time that is shown to perform the operation must be observed, in this case it indicates 5 hours, 46 minutes and 47 seconds, here in reality the time was 6 hours only that when the capture was made, a few minutes had already passed Normally contracts are for 4 hours, which is also sufficient time and is the time that is most frequently given to make contract payments, the time depends on the congestion of the blockchain that day. You should never accept a contract that only shows 2 hours to complete the transaction. In case of showing only two hours, exit the application and wait another day to buy the package.  One of the important data here is the wallet address that that sequence of numbers and letters that begins with 3LCN and ends with CPtW, that address is to which bitcoins must be transferred from a wallet that has funds for it, I must do the Warning that this address of the image is an example, it does not occur to anyone to transfer anything to it because they will surely lose their bitcoins. The address to which you must transfer the bitcoins is the one that will be generated at the time you are performing the purchase operation of a package. I suggest that this address is always copied from here and pasted into the wallet from which it will be extracted, verifying that the copied number is always the same as the one pasted and that there are no spaces before or after it is pasted, thus avoiding loss of money when making the transaction. The other data is the amount in Bitcoins, which as observed is 0.00211 BTC, which means that during the time that the purchase of the contract lasts, which in this example we already mentioned was 6 hours, a payment of 0.00211 BTC will be accepted and that amount will be equivalent to $ 25.  It must be guaranteed that when making the transfer, the amount of bitcoins that arrives at PIETRAVERDI is exactly the one requested in bitcoins in this case 0.00211 BTC because while the package purchase transaction is active that amount will be the equivalent of 25 dollars. The cost of the transaction in bitcoins is an additional value in bitcoins that is not included in the value to be transferred to PIETRAVERDI, my suggestion is that they use a normal operation cost that takes around 30 minutes or the priority one that owes around 10 minutes. A longer delay puts the receipt of payment for the package at PIETRAVERDI at risk. I recommend using the Mycelium wallet.    The contract screen should not be closed until it is confirmed that the package is already paid for. To verify that the package is paid without closing the contract screen, go to the initial tab of the browser and update the page, the paid contract will appear in status as paid. If it does not appear paid, the contract window should not be closed, wait and then refresh the page until the state says it is paid.  https://preview.redd.it/9mdxf2ivrnb71.jpg?width=1155&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f63d3e13de4acc690c46103a398c9e2ab4baa2ab      Once the contract is paid, the screen with the contract data can be closed. The initial screen will show that 75 dollars is pending payment, since 300% of the investment is recovered:    https://preview.redd.it/grjjvit3snb71.jpg?width=457&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5105252eba84f627ad500942316a0e4a7a9a6e4c  Before making a money withdrawal from PIETRAVERDI you must have a minimum amount available of 25 dollars and have the financial key that can be obtained by requesting it on the PIETRAVERDI site, accessing the options that are displayed when clicking on the user with whom you accessed being inside the site.  https://preview.redd.it/n0qta14mnnb71.jpg?width=293&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51c2843293800610f95f8d5989aa7b68a03d8506  The financial key will be sent to the Gmail email with which you registered on the site. Once you have the financial key, you can make withdrawals as long as you reach the minimum of $ 25 accumulated and available to extract. To make a withdrawal of money in you go to the Financial-Take out backoffice option:  https://preview.redd.it/wlt3106rnnb71.jpg?width=566&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb5d44d1e5df63512d28d0da523f151d6cd1da34  https://preview.redd.it/l94bcarqonb71.jpg?width=589&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d797c0f1d45973cccae4d4030e7be461e1fd5a37  Where it says carteira, the wallet address to which you are going to transfer the money will be pasted. You can delete a previously used address or add other addresses when making other extractions. Where it says value and confirm value, the amount to be extracted will be written and where it says Financial key, the financial key sent to your Gmail email will be written. The financial password that is sent to the Gmail email can be used every time you want to make money withdrawals from PIETRAVERDI, it is not necessary to change it. Great care must be taken not to leave spaces before or after the wallet address to be transferred. When all the data are correct, click on request service. PIETRAVERD charges 5% for each extraction transaction.  Final tips:   Be patient, the process of assembling the binary network can take a long time, do not expect to earn a lot of money overnight. If they are patient and follow an adequate strategy of attracting referrals over time they will reap the rewards in the form of significant profits. It is also possible to earn money by making several investments thus obtaining a compound interest and accelerating the obtaining and profits. In addition, the site has additional money stimulus forms for users that attract many additional referrals to 6% of the binary network. Once they get into the business they will see that it is an excellent way to generate sustained income over time.",3468,2021-07-16 23:24:44

If I generate a public address, let's say **12345...** and the private key that goes with it is **ABCDE**, cool. A computer did a thing and I have what I need.  What's stopping somebody else from seeing the public address 12345 and either using the same (open source?) code to get the private key?  Could anyone use the paper wallet generator code to reverse engineer 12345 and create the private key to match with it? Or the script could generate 12345 and create a new private key that is VWXYZ... either way they'd be access whatever gets sent to 12345?

PM_ME_YOUR_THESES,Bitcoin,"GOLD CUP SHITPOST: El Salvador v Mexico Hello friends and fellow HODLers.  So, lately, there's been a lot of enthusiasm around here for El Salvador, first sovereign nation to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender currency. I think we should extend our support to El Salvador in their upcoming soccer match against Mexico, in the Gold Cup!  1. About the Gold Cup  What is it? It's a soccer tournament. In soccer, there is a World governing body called FIFA which oversees the rules of the game and the organization of the World Cup (and other, smaller tournaments). National Federations of soccer clubs are, of course, members of FIFA. But other important members of FIFA are regional confederations. You've probably heard of UEFA or Conmebol. UEFA organizes the Champion's League between the top clubs in Europe and the EuroCup (recently won by Italy), while Conmebol organizes the Libertadores Cup (between the top clubs in South America) and the Copa America (recently won by Argentina). Similarly, the area of North America, Central America, and the Caribbean has its own Confederation called CONCACAF. CONCACAF organizes the region's equivalent to the EuroCup or the Copa America. It's called the ""Gold Cup"", and for commercial reasons, it's always held in the United States. This is the biggest international tournament held in America that most Americans have probably never heard of.  Usually, either Mexico or the United States wins the Gold Cup, as they are the countries with the most developed soccer infrastructure in the region. However, soccer is extremely popular in other countries in Latin America, too, like Costa Rica, Honduras, and, of course, El Salvador. In fact, [in 1969, Honduras and El Salvador went to war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_War) (literal military conflict) over a soccer match! And there's no team that Central American countries compete hardest against than Mexico, who frequently called themselves 'the giant of CONCACAF', often undeservedly, and who belittles their national team and leagues. Mexico is the team to beat.  2. About the match  So, my proposal is to cheer for El Salvador as a proxy to cheering for Bitcoin. But also, let's cheer against Mexico. Why? Here are a few reasons:  a) They suck ass. They always belittle and abuse their neighbors to the south will playing victim at the treatment they get from their northern neighbor. You've heard of the migrant crisis? Those migrants are not Mexican but Central American, many of them Hondurans and Salvadorans, and where do you think they get the most abuse? Not in ICE detention, but in Mexico's INM, not to mention, of course, the Mexican cartels...    b) Mexico is anti-bitcoin. Yes, you've heard of Salinas Pliego, the Mexican billionaire that has invested 10% of this liquid assets to bitcoin. Well, he tried to integrate bitcoin payments and bitcoin accounts into his bank, ""Banco Azteca"", and was quickly rebuffed by Mexico's banking authorities and the Central Bank, Banxico. Mexico's government's official position is that bitcoin is a ""speculative digital asset"" that has no place in the retail financial sector.   And have you heard of Agust√≠n Carstens? Agustin Carstens is the current chair of the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), so called the central bank of central banks. He's the counterpart to the IMF's Christine Lagarde, coordinating with the central banksters from around the world in case they ever need a global bailout from their fixing of the their national economies. He's also Mexican, formerly head of Banxico, and prior to that, head of Mexico's Finance Ministry. He set the policies that today put Mexico against bitcoin.   On top of that, Mexico has a long history of infringing on FIFA rules against discrimination by having the crowd yell an homophobic chant. They have done this every match, and continue to accrue penalties. FIFA has threatened them with barring them from the World Cup if the behavior continues, and since Mexico are sore-losers, the behavior will continue if they continue to lose.  c) The match. Mexico is the obvious favorite to win. But we like underdogs here, right? El Salvador, against all odds, currently leads the group. Mexico needs a win to secure passage to the next round, but El Salvador qualifies with a tie. Mexico's stars Hirving 'El Chucky' Lozano and Raul Jimenez are injured, so El Salvador has a real chance here. The game is on Sunday night. Tune in!    TL;DR: The Gold Cup is the equivalent to the EuroCup, but for North America, Central America, and the Caribbean. Usually, the finalists are USA and Mexico, and Mexico has won most often. The tournament is held in the USA. This Sunday, El Salvador play Mexico. The winner will lead their group and secure a qualification to the next round. El Salvador only needs a tie to achieve this. Mexico is the favorite, but we like underdogs. El Salvador is the pro-bitcoin team. Mexico is the anti-bitcoin team, that is also obnoxious and homophobic. So, I invite everyone here to support bitcoin by proxy of supporting El Salvador, and tune in on Sunday!",835,2021-07-16 20:39:40

So I started with $200 on cash app, buying 196.00 of bitcoin and then sent it to her. She then told me that I needed to ‚Äúsend her $500 for confirmation fee‚Äù and I told her I only had $458 left in my ENTIRE account total. She said she would be fine with it and she would help me so I get the best amount possible flipped. I sent it to her and she then stated it was ‚Äúupdated to 400‚Ä¶‚Äù so it was now at 4k being flipped and I stated I didn‚Äôt want that I just wanted to do the confirmation fee and get the 2500 back. She told me if I sent her 1k i would get my money. I told her no I don‚Äôt have that and she told me to ask friends for it. I said that‚Äôs BS and she said she would pay it off for me. Then she requested a validation of ID and SSN. I told her fuck that no. I called her out and told her to just revert it back to me and give it back, but she said basically ‚ÄúFuck you call the police idc‚Äù. I have contacted my bank and they said it was still pending on my card, and Cashapp has made a dispute claim. Is there ANY hope for me to get my money back?

Lord_Keks,Bitcoin,"When Bitcoin becomes the new Nr. 1 currency won't the rich end up having almost all of them ? Obligatory English isn't my first language, I am using Reddit mobile and I am new to Bitcoin.  As far as I understand there is an limited amount of Bitcoins, still a lot but it is limited. So my question is simple (I think). The rich (like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates) have no possible way of spending all their Money, except donating huge amounts. They are, maybe unwillingly (if that makes sense), hording a lot of Bitcoins and not spend them therefore making them not accessible to the public.  Won't the point come when the lower classes don't have access to Bitcoin anymore or a very limited amount?   Let's say there are 100 Bitcoins. 50 Bitcoins are owned by states. 30 Bitcoins are owned by the richest 10%. And the remaining 20 are owned by everyone else. (Oversimplified but I hope that makes it clearer)  The Bitcoins owned by the state and the ""normal"" population is in circulation, getting payed in salaries, spend in stores, Taxes and so on. The richest 10% being, mostly, unable to spend their wealth will get more and more Bitcoins and therefore starve the state and the general public of their main currency.   Will there be a point when we run out of Bitcoin because some people have most of them?  It could be a stupid question but it is on my mind for the past two hours and I need an answer.

_laserlife,Bitcoin,"The case for using bits and sats I know this sort of thing has been debated before and I'm glad that *sats* is becoming more recognised, especially with the growth of the lightning network, but I really think we could benefit from making **bits and sats** more widely used - particularly with wallets and merchants. Few reasons:  * Usual point about unit bias, but feels easier to grasp - *bits* already implies a smaller denomination of bitcoins, *sats* needs to be explained.    * *""You don't have to buy a whole coin, you can buy 1000 bits""* vs.    * *""You don't have to buy a whole coin, you can buy 100 000 sats""* * Easier to explain in relation to major fiat currencies:    * dollars / euros and cents    * pounds and pence * Easier to explain in relation to a bitcoin:    * 100 sats in 1 bit    * 1 million bits in 1 bitcoin * Pricing for most items makes more sense than using bitcoin or sats. People are already familiar with using 2 decimal places in commerce. Some hypothetical examples:  ||BTC|bits|sats| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Coffee|0.000095 BTC|95 bits|9500 sats| |Big Mac|0.00016 BTC|160 bits|16000 sats| |Computer|0.032 BTC|32000 bits|3200000 sats| |Article Paywall|0.00000395 BTC|3.95 bits|395 sats| |Podcast Stream|0.0000005 BTC / min|0.50 bits / min|50 sats / min|    * Future proof    * Bitcoin at $32,000 \~ $1 = 32 bits    * Bitcoin at $100,000 \~ $1 = 10 bits    * Bitcoin at $1M \~ $1 = 1 bit  This also [doesn't change or introduce any new terms](https://bitcoin.org/en/vocabulary#bit), bitcoins and sats are just as valid and should be used if it's more appropriate, just think that in most cases bits / sats is more useful.  I also don't think it would add confusion. Americans are all familiar with a cent, a dollar and a grand. People in India and South Asia all know what paise, rupees and lakhs are. I think we can manage sats, bits and bitcoins.  Thoughts?",323,2021-07-16 17:20:13
living_space,Bitcoin,"Contrarian view on CBDCs (single point) It‚Äôs obvious that everyone is keeping a close eye on the ongoings, and trust me I am like everyone here wondering what‚Äôs going to happen.   I do not have the authority to say how it will unfold, although I can speak to one specific aspect surrounding the concern of traceability.   What I hear goes something like‚Ä¶ the gov will track every transaction and we will lose even more privacy  I‚Äôm not here to defend or discount CBDCs. No matter how illogical or logical, their existence is inevitable. So instead, I‚Äôm just outlining a single point. Whether cash is in physical or digital form, anonymity (frictionless flow) will be a component in the design.   Take paper currency for example: by design not easy to track and follow. Go back further to gold coins: again, same thing.   Free flowing cash is necessary for a free market to function properly.   Breaking anonymity for some extra tax money would not add up to be enough to compensate for the friction it causes in the market.   Surprisingly, in the late 90s an American economist predicted the need for a digital currency - all while clearly stating anonymity as a function.  Time and again, friction is left out.   ‚ÄúThe one thing that‚Äôs missing, but that will soon be developed, is a reliable e-cash, a method whereby on the Internet you can transfer funds from A to B, without A knowing B or B knowing A ‚Ä¶The way I can take a $20 bill, hand it over to you, and then there‚Äôs no record of where it came from. ‚Ä¶You may get that (e-cash) without knowing who I am. That kind of thing will develop on the Internet and that will make it even easier for people using the internet‚Äù - Milton Friedman",302,2021-07-16 17:18:01

Well, I scripted it into my status bar for an update every 5 min and now everyone at work gets to see it when I share my screen lol.

jayDOT321,Bitcoin,"A walkway collapses. 114 lose their lives. Bitcoin may have fixed this.  It may seem like a stretch but hear me out. Tomorrow marks 40 years since the collapse of the Hyatt Regency walkway in Kansas City, MO. The hotel was built in the 70s during the inflation crisis.   The following excerpt from Wikipedia describes the environment at the time. Sound familiar?   The Kansas City Star described a national climate of ""high unemployment, inflation and double-digit interest rates [which added] pressure on builders to win contracts and complete projects swiftly"". Described by the newspaper as fast-tracked, construction began in May 1978 on the 40-story Hyatt Regency Kansas City. There were numerous delays and setbacks, including the collapse of 2,700 square feet (250 m2) of the roof. The newspaper observed that ""Notable structures around the country were failing at an alarming rate"", which included the 1979 Kemper Arena roof collapse and the 1978 Hartford Civic Center roof collapse. The hotel officially opened on July 1, 1980. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyatt_Regency_walkway_collapse  The effects of inflation are real. I can‚Äôt help but wonder with concern what corners are being cut as the money supply continues to forever expand putting pressure on individuals, architects and everyone really to make up the difference.",205,2021-07-16 16:56:41

You can buy a put option that protects your downside risk. For example when Eth went up to $2300 a person bought a $2200 put and when Eth hit $1900 they were able to sell there eth for $2200. at that point you can buy it back at $1900.  You also have full control of your bitcoin with your keys. Projects like this are why Bitcoin is so amazing!,94,2021-07-16 16:49:41

primalfabric,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin adoption on a rise...Number of companies accepting bitcoin is on an upward trend. For anyone looking to get started, here is a list... In the past years, bitcoin has seen tremendous growth in terms of adoption not just by people but by companies, investors, and even entire countries.   A lot of businesses are realizing the power of this digital currency and the value it holds.   There is really no better time to start accepting bitcoin payments on your webstore. The market is flooded with a number of payment gateway companies offering varying benefits to people.  One key distinction between various payment processors is based on how *decentralized* they are, a characteristic that is inherent in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Such processors usually have:   * No identity verification ‚Äî KYC/AML * Non-custodial payments (payments are *never* in custody of a third party) ‚Äî P2P \[Peer-2-Peer\] * Slightly technical setup * No fiat support  **Centralized** payment processors on the other hand offer a less technical setup but payments are usually held by third-party companies making them slightly risky.   Here is the list of the top bitcoin payment processors:  1. GoURL: It is a 100% open-source cryptocurrency payment gateway offering a **WordPress** Plugin and an **API**. For custom-made websites, GoURL offers API for various programming languages including *PHP, JSON, C++, Java*, etc.  2. Blockonomics: For BTC payments, it offers plugin integration for **WordPress**, **Prestashop, WHMCS, Wix, Squarespace,** and a **Payment API** for custom implementation. 3. BTCPay Server: A self-hosted, open-source cryptocurrency payment processor that offers plugin integration for **WordPress**, **Prestashop, Magento, Drupal, Custom Integration,** and **API.** 4. MyCryptoCheckout: A crypto payment plugin designed for **WordPress**. It's a Peer-2-Peer gateway that allows merchants to receive payment directly to their wallets. 5. CoinRemitter:  Crypto payment plugins for eCommerce merchants are available for **WordPress, Magento 2, Opencart, PrestaShop, Laravel, PHP,** and **REST APIs**.  6. CoinPayments: They offer support for hundreds of cryptocurrencies and plugins for a variety of webstores making it one of the most comprehensive payment gateways in the market.  7. Coingate:  Coingate provides support for multiple eCommerce CMS, including **WooCommerce, Prestashop, Magento, WHMCS, OpenCart**, and more, plus 100+ altcoin support.  8. BitPay: They offer plugin support for almost every eCommerce CMS including, **WordPress, Prestashop, Shopify, WHMCS, EDD, Magento, Drupal**.  9. Coinbase:  Offers support for **WooCommerce** and **Shopify** and charges no fee for crypto payments.   *Blockonomics, MyCryptoCheckout, BTCPay, GoURL* are decentralized and do not require KYC.   BitPay and Coinbase are infamous for their centralized model and have come under a lot of criticism for it but they still remain the top 2 payment companies by size and number.

somalley3,Bitcoin,"Deflationary debt spirals Naturally, it‚Äôs pretty exciting to have conversations about the many ways that Bitcoin is fundamentally changing and potentially improving the world. Whether it because it represents money for the people that is decentralized, secure and auditable, or the fact that it is provably digitally scarce and defined by a fixed currency supply making it the world‚Äôs most pure hard asset, or simply the innovations and technology being built onto its layered protocols, i‚Äôm inspired everyday by it as both a network protocol and an asset.   And while I‚Äôd be among the first to explain to others the flaws with our current monetary system, the many ways in which inflation is a form of theft, the cantillon effect and quantitative easing etc., every now and then some part of me wonders deep down whether a world with a fixed and deflationary reserve currency represents a broadly better alternative (from an economic theory perspective) or whether it simply transitions us from one extreme to the other.   The Bitcoin Standard fantasizes about the world during the gold standard and implies that a Bitcoin standard would be a permanent return to that, but I would push back and argue that there‚Äôs many more nuanced reasons as to why the gold standard failed from a business cycle and monetary perspective than simply arguing that it can only fail because of government greed and abuse.   Ray Dalio has written plenty about the dangers of deflationary debt spirals and how they can destroy a society. I wonder if, while enriching those of us who already own it, a Bitcoin standard wouldn‚Äôt be terribly restrictive of global economic growth and progress as allocation of capital becomes much more limited.  For example, many of the great technologies we enjoy today (from Facebook to Google) may never have been created because ‚Äúloose monetary policy‚Äù and low interest rates is what made it economically feasible for them to be developed and exist despite not being profitable for some period of time.   There‚Äôs many other examples of how a deflationary currency alters the dynamics behind the growth in loanable funds and investment and correspondingly GDP. Would love to hear whether others have shared the same thoughts and concerns, counter responses and alternative versions of reality, flaws in my thinking etc.   TLDR: A fixed money supply greatly limits the allocation of capital which would hinder governments from funding many of the services we rely on and stall economic growth. BTC is good at taking back freedom  but very long term (decades or centuries) i wonder if it‚Äôs good for the economy",431,2021-07-16 10:50:51

Does it make sense at the moment to emigrate to El Salvador and invest your bitcoins in local infrastructure development? I am a network engineer and unix / linux administrator. I have always dreamed of having my own ISP company, preferably in combination with a cryptocurrency mine.

It‚Äôs difficult to say how dirty Bitcoin mining is overall, but it‚Äôs a reflection of the power supply to a mine‚Äôs location. Earlier this year, tens of thousands of mining machines consumed about 45 million kilowatt-hours of power per month in an area of western China that depends on coal-burning power plants, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. That‚Äôs about 15,000 tons of standard coal. Overall, mining machines globally consume about as much power as all of Bangladesh, a country of more than 160 million people.  While some of that power is green, the majority of the world‚Äôs electricity still comes from burning fossil fuels.

I do realize that bitcoin, in it's own right, isn't a lifestyle choice that would assume equitable exchanges of homes, but I am wondering if it's a bonding enough element to form a group.

No_Examination_2681,Bitcoin,"United States citizens can no longer short Bitcoin or participate in leveraged digital asset transactions unless they're filthy rich! On June 23, 2021, the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) went into effect in the United States. The CEA set new guidelines for retail investors (people like you and me) to trade crypto with margin. For individuals or retail investors, to be eligible to trade crypto with margin, you must be certified as an Eligible Contract Participant (ECP). A retail investor must have $10 million in assets to be certified as an ECP.   You can view the requirements here.  [https://content.next.westlaw.com/7-521-8340?\_\_lrTS=20201013065041926&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&firstPage=true](https://content.next.westlaw.com/7-521-8340?__lrTS=20201013065041926&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&firstPage=true)  Additionally, you can view Kraken's new blog about leveraged digital asset transactions here.   [https://blog.kraken.com/post/9514/new-requirements-for-u-s-and-starter-tier-clients-to-qualify-for-margin-trading/](https://blog.kraken.com/post/9514/new-requirements-for-u-s-and-starter-tier-clients-to-qualify-for-margin-trading/)  So what does this mean for regular US citizens like you and me? For starters, it means that US citizens can no longer short sell bitcoin. You might ask, ""Can't we just short bitcoin without leverage?"" well no, you can't! It is impossible to short any assets without leverage since the nature of shorting involves borrowing a security, then selling it on the open market. We are once again being suppressed by the government. The US government saw that normal people were getting rich, bringing themselves out of poverty, and they decided to stop it. I have been leverage trading bitcoin for about 5 years now and I have made a good life for myself. I was able to pay off my student loans and pay off my car leveraging bitcoin in my spare time and I have always paid Uncle Sam my fair share of taxes when I profit.   Look, I am all for government regulation in crypto. I think that in order for Bitcoin to get mainstream adoption, there needs to be more government regulation. However, with this new definition of an ECP the US government is only looking after corporate America and all of their wealthy friends, not its citizens. So now if I want to short bitcoin or trade with leverage, I have to renounce my citizenship and move to another country. And obviously, I know that I can use a VPN, but the prison system in America is one of the worst in the world, and it's not worth the risk if you ask me.    .... I think it is kind of funny that the US government is always saying that Bitcoin is only used by criminals and for money laundering. Well now by leverage trading any digital asset you are now considered a criminal... unless you are filthy rich, then you're fine.",421,2021-07-15 23:39:07

As for inflation, Cryptos lose their value...go up and down. Bitcoin dropped by 50%...so if someone had put in 100K in bitcoin, their funds would have lost 50% of its value where's inflation does not do that, irrespective of the possibility that bitcoin ""might"" go up.  Typically sanctions and embargoes are against nations which prevent trade and so on; so El Salvador for example has made Bitcoin their legal tender, how exactly would that benefit them if for example They were sanctioned and embargoed?  CBDC's would be pegged to their respective currencies along with whatever other features that they give them using the blockchain technology and unlike regular paper money they would not have technological advantages that Cryptos have making them more than just ""regular fiat"", No?""

tradecheap,Bitcoin,"Considering using Lightning Network; New Questions **TLDR**  Long time buyer, holder, and user of Bitcoin (since 2015). Absolutely zero experience with Lightning Network. I've read some entry-level tutorials but still have basic conceptual questions regarding funding, capacity, revocations, etc.  **Hypothetical Situation**  Let's say I run a gambling site. All business is conducted in BTC. More and more customers are asking that Lightning Network be made available to facilitate quick and cheap deposit and withdrawal of funds.  **Where do I connect for maximum reach?**  The tutorials always seem show to show two parties, Bob and Alice. They open a ""channel"" using a funding transaction. The example then typically adds in a third party (e.g. Festus) and says something along the lines of ""and look, Bob can pay Festus through Alice.""   The implication seems to be that the network size could become enormous, to the point where anyone can pay anyone because hey, every Bitcoin user is inevitably connected by only a few degrees of separation on the network.  But this doesn't really answer the question of to whom I, as a brand new user, should connect? I could connect to you, I guess. But maybe you're a new user too and have zero other connections. Do I connect to some sort of hub? Guess that would work but doesn't that make things overly centralized?  As a site owner (see hypothetical above), is it best for me to act as a hub and open a channel with each of my users, which means I'd have thousands of channels open? Or is it better to make a single connection to one really popular, well-connected dude? Seems like the latter, but which dude? How do I find him?  **Do I always have to be online looking for cheats?**  Ok, so I get that my LN peer can try to cheat me by broadcasting a settlement transaction of a prior balance state that's more advantageous to him. And I also know that his cheat TX settlement won't clear for twenty-four hours, giving me time to broadcast a ""revocation"" TX that settles everything in my favor instead. This is what dissuades my peer from cheating.  But this also implies that my Lightning node needs to be up 24/7, or at least never offline for more than 24 hours and, furthermore, I have to be ever vigilant to make sure no one is cheating, and execute revocations if they are. Are these assumptions correct? Does the Lightning software automate the cheat-detection process for me?  **How do I Add Funds to an existing channel?**  It's still not clear how to add funds to a preexisting channel. I've seen some material online indicating that a third party service needs to be paid for this? I can't imagine that's correct is it? That doesn't seem compatible with the whole ethos of LN.  Using my hypothetical example. Let's say a client opens a channel with me and sends me 1 BTC. He bets on an upcoming UFC fight (Ronda Rousey vs. Oprah Winfrey). A successful bet on Winfrey pays 15x. That means in the unlikely even that he wins, I need to have at least 15 BTC available *on that channel* to pay him out.  How do I add funds to the channel if he wins? Or does that 15 BTC have to be placed in the channel via the initial funding transaction?  Now, if I'm servicing all users over a single channel, that's fine. But if each user has his own channel, I'd have to fund each one with an enormous amount of BTC -- despite the fact that 99.99% of my users will never even bet on that particular event at all. That would be an inefficient use of funds. I assume there's a way to add funds to a channel after initial funding, but how?  **Wallet Recommendations**  I'm running on Win 2019 Server and need to be able to create channels, send funds, be notified of incoming funds, etc. using an API. Which wallet should I use for this?  With Bitcoin's first layer, I have the option of either running a full blown node or leveraging a centralized service like Electrum? Does LN have an analogous situation with two different styles of wallet?",705,2021-07-15 21:06:38

needmoretime82,Bitcoin,Using Lightning to increase privacy of your on-chain Bitcoin Does the following increase privacy of on-chain bitcoin?    1.Open a channel using my KYC bitcoin using my own node that's operating over TOR to another lightning node.  2. Send all the funds through to a no-KYC lightning wallet like Muun  3. Use Muun to send that balance back on-chain to a bc1 address  4. Close channel and never combine the change from the channel close with the btc sent on-chain using muun.  Since transaction fees are very low at the moment this almost seems better than a coinjoin because you can see on-chain if coin has recently been through a coinjoin.,110,2021-07-15 20:58:01

SatoshiHeist,Bitcoin,"Selling calls on Bitcoin for 17% return 45 DTE Short story is that I‚Äôm short term bearish and still long term bullish. I‚Äôm 50% stables and 50% exposed. Everyone has different risk tolerance levels, you need not model off this. Some of my friends are 80% exposed and 20% stables (aggressive yet safer). You all know me by now, I can‚Äôt sell my BTC because I want to generate that 1%/week yield with the strategy I‚Äôve outlined in this post.    Bearish targets are 24k, 20k and if that doesn‚Äôt hold 15k. I‚Äôm a buyer at all 3 levels, weights will depend on factors if and when that happens. The major resistances are 39k and of course 59k. Despite slightly trending downwards, volatility has sharply fallen off a cliff, take a look below at Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility index. I suspect an increase in volatility will arrive soon from this extended period of consolidation. I‚Äôll go into more of the direction and how I plan to trade it next     https://preview.redd.it/62p11olqweb71.png?width=1233&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea401e1df9eedbf2e2a683001cd8b7cd6c496c0f    **What trades am I making for Bitcoin?**  Short calls to generate yield is the main strategy. The occasional long put protection or long put spread will be put on during expected volatility (like right now). Additionally, I just started adding size to my August short 50k call position over the last 3 days. I think I will add a little more to it but not much more.    **Quick Math:** 2 BTC @ 33k each is 66k. Target yield for August is 10k+ USD which is about 17% rounded (10k/66k). I have considerably less BTC on exchanges now and I am also transitioning to a much less management intensive trading style as it is Summer and I haven‚Äôt been outside in ages.     https://preview.redd.it/d3cxtnsgxeb71.png?width=1238&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3d421ac9e94ef0bc9e73ba705165b6d2c4b811b",291,2021-07-15 17:38:08

The past year, we saw BTC price soar through the roof because everyone and their friends were investing $$$ into it. And then we saw a HUGE crash because everyone started selling it due to panic of FUD, Elon, etc.  Recently (2-4 months), I've been reading that a lot of institutional investors and ""whales"" are buying a HUGE amount of BTC at the $35K-$40K range. If this is the case, why haven't seen the price go up and why is it still leveled at the $35K-$40K range?  If billions of dollars are being invested into BTC by these commercial investors and whales, wouldn't that drive the price up?  I hope this makes sense.",158,2021-07-15 16:21:00

W944,Bitcoin,"Instant Gratification vs Long Term Potential Hey internet srangers, what would you do in my situation?  I'm not doing great lately; at work steady growing burnout state, I'm completely mentally drained now and can't even focus on and acomplish basic tasks. Went from being the best employee to the worst employee in 3 years. Need to fix this as I'm at a point that I question my job security.  So I took all my vacation days and got 4 weeks off approved. Great!   But I can't stay home during 4 weeks, as I've been working from home for the last year and need a change of scenary to reset my brain.  Thus I had decided to buy an RV and travel for a month, maybe even work remotely from the RV afterwards until Fall, thinking that this will solve my burnout.   Found a nice RV, settled on a price, called my bank, and they refused the loan because my expense ratios are too high. I'm spending over 1000$/mo on electricity for mining so because of that I can't qualify for a high amount loan, which is frustrating as loans are dirt cheap now. I can't also just shutdown the miners for a week and reapply as they want to see a few months of consistent low electricity bills.  So now the question is; do I sell half of my crypto stack to buy the RV? We're at a sideways market now and about half of what the top was recently so it feels like it's a bad time to sell anything.  I've convinced myself that I need the RV to travel and properly reset my brain to be able to re-become effective at my day job. If I lose that job, I lose the ability to have the cashflow to pay for my mortgage and electricity bill to continue mining. Can't let that happen.  But if I sell half of my stash to buy the RV today, I'm sure that in a few years that chunk would of bought me 2 RVs, a boat and a house, and that I'd regret having sold :)   And that's my dilemma. Do I jeopardize potential future crypto gains in exchange of gratification today? Or I keep holding and because of that don't fully take advantage of my 4 weeks off and potentially lose my job because I didn't fix my burnout by the time I need to go back to work in a month.  Feels like I'm stuck here.  The obvious answer would be to do something else for 4 weeks but I don't see anything else that could occupy me outside my house for that period.",444,2021-07-15 16:18:20

Decentralization was one of the main reasons that I got into Bitcoin because I didn‚Äôt like how every other market was subject to price control via derivatives (by certain entities with unlimited capital).   Commodities prices can be suppressed by flooding/dumping paper contracts onto the market. Stocks with small floats can easily be moved. Institutional leveraged bets can even move large cap stocks.    Maybe Bitcoin has a unique characteristic that protects it from price manipulation (eg pump and dumps)?  Current stance: I‚Äôm rooting for Bitcoin to become more of a widespread currency.

Today I opened it again and found out there is a community here about Bitcoin.     My story is that I ""bought"" it when it was cheap in 2013. I was selling my car to a friend of mine, he didn't have all the money to buy it, just a part of it. He asked me to split the amount in installments. I declined, I don't like installments. Then he asked if he could pay for the rest of the value with his Bitcoins.     He explained for a long time what it was, and why it worked like money. At first, I didn't like the idea. But I wasn't needing all the money at that time, and he said he could buy it back. So we did it.     He teached me to use it though I didn't really used it for a long time. It was just sitting there. Of course I heard the news that it was getting value. This same friend told me to buy a physical wallet to hold it. He said it was more safe, and I agree. I also like to have something that is not just in my computer.     In the last years, I retired earlier. Every month I sell some of my Bitcoins to this same friend. Not any insane amount, just what I need for my family expenses etc. And sometimes some more when I need to buy something new.     I don't live a live of luxuries. I have a good house, a good car. I pay for my children college and school and we do some family travels together. And I guaranteed they have a house to live. That's enough for me     That's it, I'm not in any Bitcoin related community or discussion. I don't know how it works. My friend tried to explain me a lot of times. I know enough about it to use all these years. I know how to send, how to receive and I have my pass phrase in a paper well hidden.     I read about how you guys buy and sell it all the time. I'm not any specialist and I might be wrong. But maybe you just need a little more patience. It took a long time for my Bitcoins to be worth something.     Excuse me if I don't reply you. As I said, I don't really use Reddit   Also excuse me if I made any grammatical errors, english is not my first language and I don't live in an english speaking country.",477,2021-07-15 15:39:45

OrganizedCrimeGuy,Bitcoin,"Litecoin is friend not food  As  we all know Litecoin was disappointing in this bull run so far. It  barely reached, or depending on who you ask because we apparently have  two ATHs lol, didn't reach it. Despite this, Litecoin is still our  favorite little Chikun to hate or love. Here are my reason to love it  starting with the newest information.  # FRIENDS NOT ENEMIES:    https://preview.redd.it/i2dur1ku0eb71.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06c0140abca0bceff4269a8044052b2071f89c89  Litecoin  has constantly been marketed as the Silver to Bitcoin's gold. I know a  lot of people hate this marketing, but it's what has stuck around and  will continue to stick around. Litecoin has continued to bea oscillator  of grandpa bitcoin, and their futures will follow the same path.  Litecoin has consistently been disrespected by BTC hodlers for being a  clone of bitcoin. The faster transactions, lower fees, and increased  coin supply isn't what makes litecoin better, it's what makes bitcoin  better. Let me explain. Bitcoin is obviously the og of every crypto  project out there. It's the grandpa of the family, the old man that  commands respect and will be the first one to say his opinion on  something. Litecoin is grandpa's annoying son who helps him pay his  bills online. What I mean here is, Bitcoin's fees and slow transactions  are not a discredit to the project, but a change of use case. The people  looking to spend Bitcoin would be better off making big payment amounts  like buying houses, boats, lambos, and jets. While litecoin is better  suited to SUPPORTING bitcoin hodlers with purchases like bubblegum,  condoms, and meals with your sister's best friend. We are a team guys.  We are the early adopters. If bitcoin succeeds, we all succeed.  # NEW ACTIVITY:    https://preview.redd.it/9mfcqf8v0eb71.png?width=598&format=png&auto=webp&s=65fb12051a45f2747ccdee183a6c43324245d27f  The  fact that we have 4x the amount of ACTIVE addresses than we did 7  months ago, is astounding. 340,000 a day. Does this truly sound like a  dead coin to you? Do this truly show no use case? I'll let you decide.    https://preview.redd.it/n3yzgzhw0eb71.png?width=598&format=png&auto=webp&s=2361504d2c532ed4bc2829f6441ede1f39d1407d  # PUBLICITY:    https://preview.redd.it/di08b0tx0eb71.png?width=598&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5367ea7af504d0ee0607cf2452adbcc05421ad7  Litecoin  continuously makes appearances in places you would never expect. From  Nascar drivers to MMA fighters, litecoin is putting it's name out there.  I'll be the first one to acknowledge that Litecoin doesn't have the  apex predator of marketing teams out there, but it's impressive that  after 10 years of existence, we haven't failed like the thousands of  projects that have.  # GRAYSCALE:    https://preview.redd.it/eyifacoy0eb71.png?width=598&format=png&auto=webp&s=a864e3610b48a20397d64e09ee8d1251b32d1045  If  you've been in the Litecoin Markets sub for more than 1 day, you'll  know this is the most hopium concentrated news that we expect will show a  big bang. Grayscale has continuously loaded up on LTC this whole time.  They bought LTC during it's $400 run, they bought LTC before and after  the spike. Money this big can afford to be wrong in some areas, but not  THIS wrong. I expect big things will happen in the future with  Litecoin's price, and the people that disrespect the Chikun might be a  little salty.  # The Fundamentals:    [Anatomy of the Chikun](https://preview.redd.it/vnr73dsz0eb71.jpg?width=610&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2749b618a560a0887cbe9e1b0d498189e6a8cec0)    * 10+ years of existence * 100% uptime * Fast Transactions * Low Fees * Available on every platform that BTC is on, even paypal. * Institutions love boring, but working financial projects. * Mweb, an optional privacy feature coming soon. * Flare Network integration * Many more  # THE FUD:    [Darth Lee meets Emperor Yang](https://preview.redd.it/eow1ui151eb71.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb79e767681a2b327499bca1e94a53908dbd4b27)  And  finally to address the titan level fud that will never escape litecoin  until everyone in this generation dies, yes Charlie Lee sold fairly  mined litecoin. Whatever his motive was for doing so, whether you think  he is evil incarnate and scammed everyone or truly wanted to have  decentralized currency, it's up to you. But what we don't see is the  same fud being applied to other projects. Ethereum creator,  Vitalik and  ""managers"" premined over 70 million ethereum and sold becoming a  billionaire. How this isn't worse than selling your fairly mined coins  and tweeting that you were going to, is beyond me. That is not to say  Vitalik was wrong for doing anything! I would be Charlie Lee and Vitalik  in a heartbeat. But despite the reputation stain that hasn't left him,  Charlie has been working on Litecoin ever since. He has never left the  project, and is the main reason Litecoin is accepted on every platform  Bitcoin is. It's apart of the OG listings, and will be the only coin  with paypal that has privacy features.  I think Charlie has more or less  paid for his sins, and the fud will not change Litecoin's fundamentals  in 10 years.  Conclusion:    https://preview.redd.it/qs1ylm871eb71.jpg?width=269&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d2bc3ad5bcc360f78bee4da12dc314047100548  Bitcoin  and Litecoin are my biggest holdings in Crypto. I love the communities  surrounding them with every fiber of my being. We are the early  adopters. We are future Lamborghini holders. I really think that  everyone needs to take a step back, and ask yourself if you truly hate  Litecoin or do you just disagree with Charlie Lee, because I truly  believe that Litecoin and Bitcoin will surprise many people in the near  future.",837,2021-07-15 14:38:19

Then my hardware wallet notified I had an invalid address, I made a typo. I paused and though, am I really going to sell, is this it? No Lambo? No citadel? No trip to the moon? No this can't be it.

In economics, network effects is when a value user derives from a productervice grows as the number of other users of that product grow. Cryptocurrencies fall into that category, as the more people mine a given currency, the more computational strength a network has and the more utility all of us derive from that currency because it is more secure.   That being said, in all industries/verticals where network effects persist, the market outcome is winner-takes-all e.g. Facebook in social media, Google in search, Amazon in e-commerce, USD/EUR/JPY/CHF in fx.

Also: ""The Digital Euro is comliant with european privacy policy and does not collect its users data"". Not mentioning that Bitcoin is already achiving this goal.

Note: I am relatively new to technical analysis and this in no way constitutes any form of advice. Just happy to share my curious findings with you all.     **BTC/USD - 15th of October 2018 to 14th January 2019**  * Weekly chart, 9 period Bollinger Bands * Local high preceding volatility squeeze = $6700 * 54% correction, 2 large red candles after 1st squeeze * Huge volume spike on second red candle * Formed a multi-year bottom (never reached again) of $3100 * Time from local high to the weekly candle within second squeeze = 91 days    [Source: TradingView](https://preview.redd.it/gxqqrsfwybb71.png?width=903&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca45a21c96b7d5fdfe7766e0b0b0fa30de4fac02)    **BTC/USD - 12 April 2021 to 12 July 2021**  * Weekly chart * 9 period Bollinger Bands * Local high preceding volatility squeeze = $64,800 * 55% correction, 2 large red candles after 1st squeeze * Huge volume spike on second red candle * Local low formed of $28,500, is this a multi-year bottom? * Time from local high to the weekly candle within second squeeze = 91 days  [Source: TradingView](https://preview.redd.it/elwaok7dzbb71.png?width=470&format=png&auto=webp&s=61b886d69afc10d5830d052f2308aba64def7531)  **Conclusions**  It is very interesting to see the similarities in these two moments in time, even down to the dollar figures involved (you could multiply the 2018-19 prices by 10 and get almost the exact scenario we have today).  This could point to our recent low being the equivalent of a bear market low as experienced in the 2018-19 scenario. In the earlier scenario, a big run to the upside followed to $13,800 approximately 5.5 months later, eerily similar (by a multiple of 10) to the \~$140k price prediction of Celsius' Alex Machinsky by the end of this year.  The most notable difference between the two scenarios are that the volume was much higher in the 2018-19 scenario compared to now, but its unclear to me what impact this would have.  Whatever the case, most likely this year ***does not*** play out exactly like 2019 did, but it is still interesting to see a plausible picture of the next 6 months or so for Bitcoin.",382,2021-07-15 08:00:22

The user keeps his own private key to support mnemonics, import private keys and other functions.  Offchain wallets are centralized wallets, generally provided by exchanges. The transaction is essentially an adjustment of the amount of the internal account of the exchange. The user does not need to keep private key, but only needs to remember the account of wallet. This mode is simple to operate, and can realize real-time payment.  Poolin Wallet is an offchain wallet with high efficiency.

maxcoiner,Bitcoin,"Why Stablecoins are Doomed to Fail and Michael Saylor is WRONG about BTC not becoming a transactional currency. You may have heard Michael Saylor (and many altcoiners) talk recently about how Bitcoin is stuck as digital gold, because it's not a good transactional currency. Saylor even went so far to say in [an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1Gu7Ym-Quo&lc=z23uyjcgyzqdxptdbacdp43bmhr2al5dqctrtce4bipw03c010c) a day or two back that Stablecoins, specifically, will fill that niche.    Anyone who was around in the early days of bitcoin or has read cyphperpunk history can easily tell you what the government used to do to anyone or any company that tried to compete with the dollar. Stablecoins are run by centralized parties like companies and governments are never going to let them compete with their money when they can just tell the centralized party to stop. US congressmen went nuts a year or two back when Facebook announced Libra, and held a grand congressional inquiry just on the plans, stopping his original approach. They'll continue to stop future approaches too as long as he tries to make a coin that competes with the dollar in any way.  But even if you think there is some loophole, there's another, more important reason why bitcoin will in fact destroy any other coin, stable or not, that tries to be a medium of exchange.  In short, the best money that everyone desires is the hardest money. The hardest money is the one with the best store of value features. Gold proved this for millennia. Saylor fails to remember that gold was the most used medium of exchange for most of the last 5000 years!   When your hard property takes on the  characteristics of a currency, (being portable, scarce, fungible, easily  identified, hard to counterfeit, durable, etc) then it's called ""Hard""  money. That's a good thing. It's the money that you hold onto more than  other money, but it's still the most desirable money.    Goldbugs and Austrian economics have long sang the praises of hard money. Separating hard money from transactional money has only been done because of government decree. (Fiat) Transactional money on it's own simply cannot compete with hard money on an open marketplace.   Stablecoins will never be able to compete with bitcoin because they aren't desirable to hold on to. People will never trust them to store value over time, so why hold them at all? Why BOTHER to hold two types of money when you trust one and not the other? It's an unneeded hassle.  I give this stablecoin fad another 4-8 years tops. After that, all you can depend on in this world is your bitcoin, and the lightning network will be more than capable by then to make it more useful as a transactional currency than any other money on earth.   Now the question is: Is Saylor wrong on purpose to avoid some kind of government backlash against bitcoin?",478,2021-07-15 05:34:02

Ryanliubt-miners,Bitcoin,"BTC mining will still be less difficult but analysts say the bull market has not yet reached its peak July 14, Hefei online published an article ""I comprehensively clean up and shut down the virtual currency mining project"" pointed out that in the next three years, the province's electricity supply and demand situation is grim, Anhui will fully clean up and shut down the virtual currency mining project. ¬†Prior to this, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Yunnan and Sichuan have also issued relevant policies to promote the liquidation of crypto-mining projects. ¬†As the policy came out, the Bitcoin hashing rate dropped. ¬†  However, the latest data showed an average bitcoin processing power of 96.6 eH , slightly higher than the previous 90.5 eH . ¬†At the next reset, the difficulty of mining could be reduced by 11.08%, the data estimated, a slight downward trend from the last drop of more than 20%. ¬†  Analysts say that as the gradual completion of the evictions and a steady migration of remaining miners have leveled off the Bitcoin network, computing power has leveled off and the difficulty has eased. ¬†  In addition, half of the world's computing power will eventually leave China and need new ""homes,"" said Castleisland Ventures founding partner NicCarter. ""Chinese miners or those registered in China are looking to Central Asia, Eastern Europe, the United States and Northern Europe."" ¬†  According to public data, the first batch of virtual currency mining machines arrived in Kazakhstan on June 21. 320 mining machines are estimated to be 18.2PH/S, and are expected to be deployed and put into operation on June 27. Other mining machines are also being shipped overseas in batches. ¬†A handful of virtual currency mines are already in Kazakhstan, Texas, Canada, Europe and elsewhere. ¬†  To date, Iranian authorities have authorized 30 cryptocurrency mines to conduct digital currency mining. ¬†The cryptocurrency mines are spread across several regions, including one in Tehran province, which is home to the national capital. ¬†Semnan province is reported to have the most licensed mines with six, followed by Alborz province with four, Mazandaran, Eastern Azerbaijan and Zanjan. ¬†  U. S. utility Talen Energy is building a nuclear crypto mine and data center near its Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania, with a capacity of 164 megawatts in the first phase and 300 megawatts when completed. ¬†Talen Energy founded Cumulus Data in 2020 to ""invest in opportunities to merge digital infrastructure with power."" ¬†Cumulus has two separate businesses, Cumulus Data, which focuses on ultra-large-scale computing centers, and Cumulus Coin, which focuses on digital currency mining. ¬†  In addition, US-based cryptocurrency consultancy and mining company Wattum has signed an agreement to acquire a crypto mine operated by Energix in Kazakhstan. ¬†The two companies will build a mining facility to provide 16 megawatts of energy for mining machines and have committed to invest $2 million in the joint venture. ¬†Wattum and Energix are also negotiating for another 50-megawatt mine at a cost of $8 million ¬†  It is worth noting that the migration of miners has been accompanied by a growing search for clean energy. ¬†Bitmain has been holding information sessions for customers looking for clean power. ¬†The US House of Representatives has also recently passed legislation requiring public companies to disclose environmental, social and governance (ESG) indicators. ¬†The bill passed by a vote of 215 to 214 and now goes to the Senate for consideration. ¬†The bill also requires the SEC to establish a ""sustainable finance advisory board"". ¬†The bill's passage could help shift bitcoin miners to clean energy. ¬†  In addition, billionaire Chrissacca said he owns many cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, and believes their environmental costs will drive the development of clean energy solutions. ¬†  With the migration of miners and the search for clean energy. ¬†Many analysts believe the bull market is not over yet. ¬†Analyst Willywoo recently tweeted that the estimated number of users on the Bitcoin chain is growing faster than at any time in its 12-year history, even at this stage. ¬†  In his latest video predicting when the Bitcoin bull market will end, crypto analyst NicholasMerten points out that we're seeing cycle extensions of 11 to 13 months per cycle.  So if we follow history, we can add 12 months here.  Forty-seven months is the expected length of the cycle we're in right now...  We are still far from the expected 47 months -- November 2022 is the top of what we should expect.",732,2021-07-15 03:09:10

kriskastro,Bitcoin,"Are crypto coins the future and a threat at the same time? (Discuss)  Guys, check out this news:  [https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&sl=pt&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Finstitutopropague.org%2Fnoticias%2Femissao-de-dolar-digital-deve-levar-anos-segundo-fed%2F](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&sl=pt&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Finstitutopropague.org%2Fnoticias%2Femissao-de-dolar-digital-deve-levar-anos-segundo-fed%2F)    Asked about the Fed's plans for a digital dollar, Powell replied: ‚ÄúAs we are the international reserve currency, we believe we need to get this right and we don't feel the need to go first. In fact, we already have the pioneering advantage because we have the world's reserve currency. ‚Äù   ... On the rise of stablecoins (stable cryptocurrencies), Powell stated that ""There is clearly a demand \[for currencies\] and we have been very focused on providing better regulatory responses to potential global stablecoins."" According to Powell, studying stablecoins is a top priority for the Fed, as ""they can become systemically important overnight.""    Now get back here.  Have you ever stopped to imagine this: most countries in the world have their international reserves in dollars - Brazil, for example, has $356 billions - news in March 2021). Thus, it is not possible to deny that this is a fiat currency that move the world and business as a whole.  A series of concerns thinking here:  1- How is it that the ""health"" of cryptocurrencies can be maintained in the long term with the main ""threat"" being the ""centralization"" of central banks and their fiat currencies? Or the Opposite: How can central banks enter the decentralized world of cryptos in a way that does not undo all the power and underwritten capacity of their fiat currencies? It's a knot in the brain üòÜ.  2 - Here comes a number of other things in my mind: bitcoins, for example, are finite... which would prevent a person from just concentrating all this power for themselves in a physical wallet (imagine the hardware with all the Bitcoins already created in the world ü§£. This is a Rich guy!!!), or within digital central banks in your countries?  I go even further: would it be possible to still have a universal crypto currency of free circulation that has the same power as the dollar has today?",341,2021-07-14 19:53:59

Western_Reading4875,Bitcoin,"Orignal post by u/xcryptoguru - EXPOSED: Tesla lost its carbon credits market in Europe so it's trying to create a renewable credits market by attacking Bitcoin mining  I'm going to try to explain Elon Musk's seemingly ""big brain"" but actually pretty dumb gambit with regards to Bitcoin mining. Note carefully the dates on each development in the story.  Why did Tesla buy $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin?  Couple of factors - one short-term and one long-term.  **Short-term play** \- Tesla's production was halted due to supply chain effects from the pandemic. This is why there has been a lot of delivery delays this year. This meant that Tesla's shrinking profits from selling carbon credits to other carmakers alone wasn't enough to post a profitable quarter. So Tesla decided to buy Bitcoin and then sell some of it before the end of the quarter to make up for the shortfall.  [Bitcoin purchase ensured profitable Q1 2021 for Tesla](https://preview.redd.it/2cbuwb9xt4b71.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f26f8d68c1e3d87def0783972627696905d5368)  **Long-term play** \- The reason for Tesla's revenue from carbon credits sales shrinking is that European carmakers are shifting focus to EV themselves, meaning they no longer need to purchase credits from Tesla to comply with strict emissions regulations in the EU.  [2020 was Tesla's first-ever net-positive year thanks to soaring carbon credits sales](https://preview.redd.it/4xyofb47u4b71.png?width=1010&format=png&auto=webp&s=821d0344237233cc0322cf0daa03bb0c0282e66f)  [But that source of revenue is now shrinking \(May 6\)](https://preview.redd.it/cqcxl5kbu4b71.png?width=914&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4121b24c5321d3530eb4e306d0da98193446a3f)  So Tesla now needs to make up for this potentially permanent revenue loss. What do they do?  **One day before Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin payments due to** ***""rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions""*****, Tesla applied for renewable credits certificate from the EPA.**  [Tesla applied for renewable credits one day before Bitcoin mining FUD \(May 12\)](https://preview.redd.it/bxtcrpigu4b71.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3a8106383a5b92051bde86f2136fdcc5f2932ab)  Unlike carbon credits, the EPA's renewable credits can be sold in the open market to ANY industry. Elon figured he could create a new renewable credits market out of Bitcoin mining.  Too bad for Elon Bitcoin mining uses 4x higher than the average share of renewables in the US (56%)  The dumbest part of all this has to be the use of ""and transactions"" because no incremental energy is used for transactions. This guy frankly has zero understanding of how Bitcoin works.  Personally, I don't think he cares to understand. Notice how he's trying to hijack dog coin and turn it into PayPal.  **Bitcoin does not benefit beneficiaries of the fiat pyramid scheme. Tax-dodging billionaires who get free money from the government making the rest of our money worth less are at the top of the pyramid and they're loving it!** ***(credit iTruth84)***  [Billionaires reap all the benefits from inflation.

People are investing in the idea of getting rich quick and selling  back to fiat and use fiat for everyday transactions. This buying and selling of crypto currencies make it extremely volatile making it not a great asset for every day transactions. In the end fiat currencies win. Inorder for crypto to win ,people need fo use it for their true purpose which is as a currency which means people buying crypto and using it for transactions which means transferring crypto from one wallet to another and not selling it making crypto stable and can be successful longterm",143,2021-07-14 13:31:47

I'm sure I'm not the first one thinking about this, but as I see, if Bitcoin was the global reserve currency, one of the effects it would have on our world is that we would have less junk and useless stuff. Less plastic less trash and in general, people would buy less things and those thing would be things that is really needed.   If people know they money will worth more over time (even if it's just by a little) they will not spend it on useless stuff that they don't really need. That would make entrepreneurers pursue projets and products that are actually useful or at least quality and valuable.   Meaning that eventually production of stupid and useless junk would stop, and by time, there would be no junk (or at least t much less) that is polluting our oceans and environment.  It's basically the result of deflation instead of inflation. What are your thoughts? Would this be one of the results of adoption?",185,2021-07-14 08:38:02

xcryptogurux,Bitcoin,"EXPOSED: Tesla lost its carbon credits market in Europe so it's trying to create a renewable credits market by attacking Bitcoin mining I'm going to try to explain Elon Musk's seemingly ""big brain"" but actually pretty dumb gambit with regards to Bitcoin mining. Note carefully the dates on each development in the story.  Why did Tesla buy $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin?  Couple of factors - one short-term and one long-term.  **Short-term play** \- Tesla's production was halted due to supply chain effects from the pandemic. This is why there has been a lot of delivery delays this year. This meant that Tesla's shrinking profits from selling carbon credits to other carmakers alone wasn't enough to post a profitable quarter. So Tesla decided to buy Bitcoin and then sell some of it before the end of the quarter to make up for the shortfall.  [Bitcoin purchase ensured profitable Q1 2021 for Tesla](https://preview.redd.it/2cbuwb9xt4b71.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f26f8d68c1e3d87def0783972627696905d5368)  **Long-term play** \- The reason for Tesla's revenue from carbon credits sales shrinking is that European carmakers are shifting focus to EV themselves, meaning they no longer need to purchase credits from Tesla to comply with strict emissions regulations in the EU.  [2020 was Tesla's first-ever net-positive year thanks to soaring carbon credits sales](https://preview.redd.it/4xyofb47u4b71.png?width=1010&format=png&auto=webp&s=821d0344237233cc0322cf0daa03bb0c0282e66f)  [But that source of revenue is now shrinking \(May 6\)](https://preview.redd.it/cqcxl5kbu4b71.png?width=914&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4121b24c5321d3530eb4e306d0da98193446a3f)  So Tesla now needs to make up for this potentially permanent revenue loss. What do they do?  **One day before Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin payments due to** ***""rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions""*****, Tesla applied for renewable credits certificate from the EPA.**  [Tesla applied for renewable credits one day before Bitcoin mining FUD \(May 12\)](https://preview.redd.it/bxtcrpigu4b71.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3a8106383a5b92051bde86f2136fdcc5f2932ab)  Unlike carbon credits, the EPA's renewable credits can be sold in the open market to ANY industry. Elon figured he could create a new renewable credits market out of Bitcoin mining.  Too bad for Elon Bitcoin mining uses 4x higher than the average share of renewables in the US (56%)  The dumbest part of all this has to be the use of ""and transactions"" because no incremental energy is used for transactions. This guy frankly has zero understanding of how Bitcoin works.  Personally, I don't think he cares to understand. Notice how he's trying to hijack dog coin and turn it into PayPal.  **Bitcoin does not benefit beneficiaries of the fiat pyramid scheme. Tax-dodging billionaires who get free money from the government making the rest of our money worth less are at the top of the pyramid and they're loving it!** ***(credit iTruth84)***  [Billionaires reap all the benefits from inflation.

Right now we are in the midst of a great transition from China being the mining super power to potentially the US being the next mining super power.  If there is a cyber attack event in the US, in which the damages will be bigger than covid, then that can take out possibly over 60% of the hash power leaving the network potentially vulnerable.  That right there is an attack vector for someone but not only will it take out the hash power, but it is likely that the media will blame Bitcoin for the outages. They will spew a bunch of bs about it's energy consumption and say that's why we have no air conditioning.  They'll say it's because of those damn greedy bitcoiners.  The public will believe them because they always outsource their thinking to ""experts"" and there will be an outcry.  Our politicians will attack bitcoin with anti bitcoin bills that contain extreme ESG compliance laws that attempt to subvert the bitcoin network by controlling the American miners.  Then if American politicians have a way of controlling all American miners while America holds over 60% of the hash... then that's not good.    I think all too often we think Bitcoin is invincible.

But is it healthy? Probably not. How often is correct to check, and how to actually do this?     I'm not gonna share my full story but it's like many of yours. At first I checked all the time to track dips to deploy my funds. But once my money was invested the behavior persisted. I had no intention of how often to check, so it just kind of happened. Dozens of times a day. See green, be happy, see red, heart starts pounding and feel bad. All day every day. Very distracting!  I'll suggest the correct frequency to check the Bitcoin price is once per day. Never checking your money is irresponsible. Checking once a day is reasonable. And there's something magic about once a day. It gives you a small thing to look forward to and something to practice delaying gratification. Will you check first thing in the morning? Probably not, you'll want to push it back until later in the day.   If you are in Bitcoin, you're going to have to delay gratification.

Buggy3D,Bitcoin,"Think there will only ever be 21 million BTC?‚Ä¶ think again‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs already way more in circulation I know a bunch of crypto hodlers hope BTC will rise to the moon.   Here is one reason why it probably won‚Äôt, and one you should be familiar with.   Step 1) start an exchange.   Step 2) sell fake BTC to anyone sending you real cash, and store it on an exchange based wallet.  Step 3) show the person they are now in possession of some BTC, despite them not having any.   Rinse and repeat 2 million times.  99% of people storing their crypto will never pull out. Most keep it ‚Äúsafely‚Äù stored on your exchange.   For the 1% that actually do want to cash out, simply use the money the other 99% sent you and purchase the BTC they wish to withdraw.   To avoid too many people withdrawing at once, place strict withdrawal limits and in a worst case scenario, claim ‚Äútechnical difficulties‚Äù until demand dies down or until BTC becomes cheap enough that you can process the withdrawals.   End result: way more people now think they own BTC than they actually do. People trade all that fake crypto on the exchanges, and set a price that is mostly determined by all that fake BTC.   Those that actually possess BTC set their prices based on what they see on these centralized exchanges, and thus, the market price remains heavily manipulated to the downside.   All these centralized exchanges are essentially one big Ponzi scheme.",250,2021-07-14 02:57:03

cryptomann1,Bitcoin,"Why Core does not support the ""spawn a wallet with 12 words"" format? For instance in Electrum when you create a wallet you can spawn your wallet anywhere on the planet by remembering 12 words. This is insanely useful. With Core you have to carry a wallet.dat, and then encrypt this file and try to hide it somewhere safe. You can't cross borders with encrypted data since they stop you on customs check, airports, etc. If you upload the wallet.dat online even if temporarily and encrypted it is a risk because it got saved on some HDD server.  Anyway my point is, why you can't do this in Core exactly?   What i've found related to this is this:  [https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/88237/is-there-a-reason-to-why-bitcoin-core-does-not-implement-bip39](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/88237/is-there-a-reason-to-why-bitcoin-core-does-not-implement-bip39)  Andrew Chow explained how BIP39 isn't considered secure and that is why Core does not implement it. But then he also explains Electrum does not use this anymore, yet Electrum still gives you the option to spawn wallets with 12 words. On the Electrum website they say:  ""Electrum 2.0 derives keys and addresses from a hash of the UTF8 normalized seed phrase with no dependency on a fixed wordlist."". So the question would be, why isn't Core using this method for wallets then? Electrum devs still consider secure the ""show 12 words for seed"" method when creating wallet, why not Core?",220,2021-07-13 22:10:04

Spherical-PoV,Bitcoin,"Optimistic thought... Could it be that the ancient value system that is overly corrupt today was the only way to move forward economically with the resources they had at that time? And then over time new generations born into money manipulated themselves subconsciously to believing they are the elite which turned to corruption and manipulation of the government? The government didn't get created for evil, they originally created themselves for the protection of value. They gave power to the smart people that found ways to store value only to get controlled by them later on. Maybe Satoshi are the governments taking back control from the shadows? Or maybe the people that started it all knew corruption would be part of life but it was still the only way to get economies going at that time and now we finally have enough global peer-to-peer power of information to stabilize the corruption and concentrated power. What purpose could the government have for making your life miserable? The happier we the people are, the less headache they have, the less fear of anarchy and death they face, the less hard decisions and loss of sleep(the non-corrupt ones) they face... This may be a very childish thought process, I didn't even know how a credit card worked until 3 months ago, so this is a point of view created by true life ignorance :) but still happy thoughts.

JohnnyBlack22,Bitcoin,"I Don't Want to be My Own Bank There's a funny little quip when people get mad after they lose their coins:  ""I want to be my own bank.""  ""I lost the keys to my bank.""  It's tongue-in-cheek, but it's actually quite accurate. Being your own bank is a ton of responsibility, and if you wanted that, you pay the price if you mess up.  But I, and I think many other people as well, really *don't* want to be our own bank. We're very happy to pay a small fee for someone else to store, manage, and secure our wealth.  Banking itself is not the issue. Banking is a useful, free-market evolved service that many people (like myself) absolutely love. All I need is to hold my wealth in a *currency* that isn't controlled by someone else.  Let's say the risk free return on capital is 6%. I'd be happy to take 4%, and have whoever does my banking take 2%. It'll be someone super familiar with private keys, and backups, and scams, and hackers. That's what I want. To pay for a banking service the same way I currently do, but a service built on top of a non-inflationary, decentralized asset.  I think being your own bank is *extremely* overrated, and ""not your keys, not your coins"" is not a tenable long term situation. It puts an extremely large burden on every citizen to spend hours and hours studying security and technology, just to secure their wealth. It ignores the entire driver of modern civilization: *specialization.*  No one can print more Bitcoin. The ability to create currency out of thin air (or essentially free credit) and give it to your constituents is the real problem. Banking itself, again is simply a useful, free-market industry which there will still be plenty of demand for in a Bitcoin world.  I think ""banking"" and ""central banking"" have gotten confused over the last decade. Every industry is corrupted when it's in bed with government, and banking is no different. Banking itself is not the problem, and banking built on top of a deflationary currency should be quite a useful service in the future.",361,2021-07-13 19:48:40

matadordedweeb,Bitcoin,"Police arresting people involved with money laundering using cryptocurrencies The blockchain is public and this in my opinion is the reason why most of these arrests are successful. Wallets can easily be traceable with professional help.  However, just because cryptocurrencies are one way of storing and moving value it doesnt mean crypto is BAD! criminals will ALWAYS find ways to commit crime and crypto is just another option.   Dont BLAME crypto for making this way of life easier!  Criminals will always be criminals but at least with BLOCKCHAIN tech we are able to keep our eyes opened for any misuse.  Crypto is the future and will be here to stay; this is just the beginning.  Back in 1994, Amazon started in a garage and with the help of investors developed a great website which back in the day the Internet was just consolidating and what kind of foundation did websites have back then? There were lots of scamming websites, practically every email inbox was filled with spam.  Fast forward 27 years and most people are aware of the problems mentioned above BUT the internet got regulated; we can easily confirm if a website is a scam or not just by googling it.  Of course there are coins that are for pump only but most companies that have their own coin have a goal in mind with its own environment to run.  Imagine going to a DMV without physically carrying any form of ID and being able to get an ID replacement by just logging in through a blockchain that has all your info saved... They would scan your fingerprint/eyeballignature to confirm your true identity...  Carrying wallets, money, documents etc in public is not safe in many places of the world and very few places you are able to do so.   In other words, crypto is here to revolutionize the world.  Blockchain tech just needs regulation, education of its use and adoption.  Slowly and more importantly the environment will strive if we dedicate 100% renewable energy to the crypto industry.",339,2021-07-13 16:53:12

fatum4eg,Bitcoin,"Noob questions about BTC Guys, before I invest all my lunch money into BTC I want to ask you if you could share your wisdom on BTC future. As far as I understand, it is believed that BTC can (willhould) become a primary transaction medium like fiat money. But there are few things that bother me:  1) Volatility. It is impossible to plan you investments with such crazy volatility and unpredictability of BTC value. How can we avoid it?  2) No easy way to balance the amount of circulating BTC. It is inevitable that some BTC will always be lost due to human and technical errors, but the complexity of mining always goes up (or do I get it wrong?). It means that there will liquidity shortages and no way to smooth it or is there?  3) Very slow transaction speed. Ok, the speed is much better than bank wire transfer, but if I want to buy a cup of coffee, I want an instant transaction. Is it possible to achieve with BTC?  4) Energy waste. BTC mining looks like an incredibly wasteful business. You literally waste energy and equipment. Is there a way to transform mining into something useful?",200,2021-07-13 16:36:23

aLebanese,Bitcoin,"3 Reasons Why a U.S. Bitcoin ETF Will Be Approved Soon And Be The Next Major Catalyst **1. Regulation Could Clear Way for Bitcoin ETF**: Senator Warren's request that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler develop a regulatory framework for crypto exchanges could be a blessing in disguise for the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. The SEC may be delaying approval due to U.S. government concerns about crypto. Warren asked Gensler to respond by the end of July, which could finally get the ball rolling on crypto regulation. The SEC likely can't approve a Bitcoin ETF until government officials are satisfied with crypto regulation, and the push from Warren could speed up the process.  **2.** **An ETF Fixes Deviations From NAV**: Bitcoin ETFs already exist around the world, and all of them use crypto exchanges without problems. However, U.S. fund investors can only get Bitcoin exposure indirectly through Grayscale's GBTC, a private trust. It has a limited number of shares outstanding so can't be arbitraged, causing the price to deviate from its underlying NAV. This wouldn't happen in an ETF because shares can be created and destroyed. Bitcoin is volatile so an ETF structure would likely track it well.  **3.** **Fourteen Filings Await SEC Approval**: The longer the SEC delays, the more ETF filings it will face. There are already 13 from issuers. Almost all have filed for an ETF that would store Bitcoin physically, like GLD and gold. Grayscale also filed to convert GBTC into an ETF, which brings the total to 14. More issuers are likely to file soon to help meet the estimated $20-$40 billion in pent-up demand that may flow into Bitcoin ETFs in their first 3-6 months. Bitcoin ETF assets could eventually top $100 billion. (*Source: Bloomberg Intelligence)*",290,2021-07-13 15:15:27

annherring,Bitcoin,"AGRA WOOD POLSKA SCAM, FREELANCE GRAPHIC DESIGNER IDENTITY THEFT AND FRAUD, Bitcoin, TOMASZ NOWACZYK, TOBY LAURIE,posbit.io, Upwork, Telegram Hi all!  My goal is to ruin scammers fraud activities that affecting us Freelancers and making our proffesion harder than ever before!   Scammers: Toby Laurie, Tomasz Nowaczyk   Scam company: Agra wood Polska  I was literaly one step before loosing money (unfortunetley they do have my ID and adress as I was blinded enough with their legit scam and signed on their scam bitcoin website).  Update on their scaming organization:  I was approached via Upwork platform as I am freelancing with them. The guy's who send me a proposal is Toby Laurie. This time it is about a polish company ""Agra Wood Poland"". (My research showed that this is their another scam as there are freelancers being approached by them, only using different names via LinkedIn)   Ha! Funny enough I am Polish based in UK, so I did a research and the company acctually exisist, so the whole thing seemed to be legit! He even passed me to talk details with a CEO of the company Tomasz Nowaczyk (which funny enough it is a real person and registerd as CEO of the fellow company in Polish FCA). ... I must admit they are on top of their game stilling people's identity or creating a content for a perfect scam.  Here it is the proposal (entry to scam you) I copied form Upwork posted by Toby Laurie:  ""We are a Polish manufacturing company. We manufacture wooden pallets. Our product is in great demand in the B2B market. But we want to grow even more and capture new markets, for this we need a new visual shell. First, we need to draw a logo, we do not yet have a clear vision of what we want, but we have a clear idea and positioning of our company, so I think this is even better than just pictures. I will consider vacancies for a designer of any level, since in my opinion sometimes you should look at a business under a new, not spammed look. Therefore, if you are a hardworking and responsible designer. We will be glad to work with you.""  [https://www.upwork.com/ab/proposals/1399460237845106688](https://www.upwork.com/ab/proposals/1399460237845106688)  It is very disturbing as they seem to expand their ""business"" to the platforms that I thought would be safe for us freelancers.   Now looking back I can see I've ignored so many red flags. After finding other frelancers posts I noticed they have the same pattern for approach, wich is a Frellance platform, than taking you to Telegram climing that is the only trust worth platform to comunicate to have long negotiations and consulations (erning trust), being so professional at all times (masters!), they will waste your time on creating contracts and questionaries to finally offer you a 10.000 euro for a logo and brand identity, and of course payment in bitcoin only. The only thing that might vairy is the country of the ""business"" and names of people involved in this.  Until the first main part everything seemed to be perfect. Contract was signed, the qestionaries explained and briefs sent. Basicly the payment was the only last step before kicking off with the project.   I provided them with my BTC wallet and this is where things became shady.  I should of stop in the moment when Tomasz said he has limitations on withdrawing BTC to external wallets, so in order to proceed with the project I have to sign with [posbit.io](https://posbit.io/)(do not ever do it-its a scam). I did it and day after I gegreted it bit time!  This website is well done. I had to ask for help my friend who is trading cryptocurrency full time to verify them as there is almost nothing online. That moment I found out they are nowhere to be registered in FCA in UK and he never came accross them, which is obviously so odd if you are a real business!!   To get y'all a bit more familiar with a fake trading crypto site, this what happens:  When you try to withdraw BTC they will tell you to trade it through their ""trusted exchange sites"" such as payeer or bestchange-please don't. They are fakes and will always ask you to put money in first in order to trade their fake bitcoin, to simply collect the missing puzzels and collect all your personal data (as they already have your ID and adress, da...).   Let me paste the message from their ""support memeber"":  ""Greetings! Our System has no commission for Withdrawal, and also performs fast transactions. However, it does not support fiat currencies, but only provides access to the work of these cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, USDT and Ethereum. In order to withdraw funds to a Bank Account or PayPal, you can, for example, use an online exchanger (you can find it here Bestchange.com) or a multi-currency Wallet (for example, Payeer.com). You need to use Withdraw Tab, where you need to specify an External Bitcoin Wallet (exchanger Wallet or your External Bitcoin Wallet). By withdrawing funds to an External Wallet in any way that we wrote about above, you can Withdraw your BTC to USD.""  And if you will try to tranfer a bitcoin to your external wallet (where real bitcoins are) they will pull out this thing with you having only 95/100 points on their website and in order to withdraw money you have to deposit 0,025 btc (another attempt to steal your credit card details to have a full set needed to trade your identity). Without this last missing puzzle they can't do much. However you still want to prevent the worse just incase and report a fraud with the gov insitutions in your country. Also just to be extra safe I would advice you to put an allert on your credit score apps to prevent a hacking attacks traight away.   Quoted message from their ""support"" when asked how can I connect my trusted external wallet to reansfer BTC:  ""Thanks for your waiting. We apologize for the delay in replying. Your account has been successfully verified, however according to clause 12.1 of our Terms & Conditions, the System uses a scoring model for assessing the security quality of the User's account based on more than 170 internal and external publicly available behavior parameters, technical data and other internal corporate metrics. The maximum possible score for the security of the User's account is 100 points. Your account's security quality score is 95/100, which means that you have almost the maximum level. However, according to clause 12.3. of our User Agreement: ""Wallets whose balances have reached at least once the amount 0.15 BTC (or the same value in other currencies) can Transfer Funds from Posbit Account into an External Account and Internal Addresses only with an account security level of 100 (security level is an internal scoring model for assessing the security quality of Posbit system accounts)"". Thus, you need to get 100 of the account's security quality score. To get it, You should link your External Account to Posbit Account. To link link Your External Account to Posbit Account, You need to make a Deposit of the exact amount of 0.025 BTC from External Account. This Deposit will be credited to Your Bitcoin wallet and will be available for withdrawal immediately after crediting. After linking Your Bitcoin wallet, Your account will have 100 points of account's security quality score and, accordingly, the withdrawal of all types of crypto currencies will resume instantly.""  I was lucky enough to step back from it in last minute but I know many of my fellow freelance designers weren't lucky enough and lost money with them identity thiefs...  Now I am on the process reporting a crypto fraud and hopping that my adress and ID won't be affected. However I will probably spend extra time making sure that it won't happen..  Dear Guys, I know it is tempting to get such a great deal from someone aspecialy during this unconvinient times and it is so easy to go with the flow as the great opportunity was offered, but please think and research a person/business three times before you find yourself in the corner!  Always ask second opinion, make sure your potential client is willing do zoom video chats and they have no problem with payments to your trusted wallets, a specially if you are taking payments with BTC.  Stay creative! Stay safe!  Cheers,",1403,2021-07-13 13:35:24

xcryptogurux,Bitcoin,"Educational: Bitcoin is more than money. It's the network layer of the decentralized Internet. Taproot unlocks the seamless integration of the application layer If you can imagine a scenario where an altcoin somehow ""flippens"" Bitcoin, then you really don't understand why Bitcoin holds value to humanity.  [How they steal your Bitcoin. Remember the Bitcoin ICO? Right, there wasn't one!](https://preview.redd.it/0rfw58rlbza71.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f80112ec07e750706a764f258ed4e2f61a14f836)  **Bitcoin is the culmination of humanity's 7000-year quest to perfect a democratic, disintermediated system for value exchange**.  It separates the monetary system from the state/central entity and sets every man in the world free from other men.  [ Central banking: The last vestige of slavery ](https://preview.redd.it/hksrkimr2za71.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47682fe3a840261ce50bd115d75728929a0da108)  [ Properties of sound money ](https://preview.redd.it/t0n3irkq2za71.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57696330c9e22dc01b319363d302a0a4b80aa87d)  There are three fundamental properties of Bitcoin that altcoins will never have because all altcoins compromise on one or more of these fundamental non-negotiable aspects to market themselves as ""better"" at the cost of security.  **Mathematically Infallible**  There is not an entity that's capable of enforcing change to the protocol or monetary policy in Bitcoin. Nobody can change Bitcoin's monetary policy, period. The issuance rate 10, 20, 50, 100... years from now is known and nothing can be done to change it.  Other protocols have already shown how unreliable they are in this regard because a single person/entity is effectively in charge.  We've seen u/vbuterin repeatedly meddle with his coin's protocol direction and monetary policy. If Buterin wakes up tomorrow and goes ""let's cancel PoS"" or ""let's cap the supply"", then you bet your bottom dollar that will happen.  **Real-world Cost Input**  No barrier to entry to participate in the issuance and distribution of coins. You can buy a miner and start mining even if you have 0 sats. The cost input is not a barrier.  The recurring cost input from miners is what links Bitcoin to the physical world and makes sure that miners don't just hoard the coins they mine but are forced to redistribute them. Bitcoin's network architecture, interface with the physical world and difficulty algorithm are key components of Bitcoin's meticulous game theory equilibrium.  This is one of the reasons POW is indispensable. With POS, there's no link to the physical world and the rich keep getting richer without any real-world cost to cover.  **Self-verifiable Truth**  This is arguably the most important aspect of Bitcoin. The cost to run a full node is very cheap. Because it's cheap, you don't need to run your node on centralized cloud servers like AWS which happens with almost all altcoins.  This was the crux of the blocksize wars and why Bitcoiners went to war with miners and corporate interests in 2017 and unflinchingly defended the right for every person to be able to run their own node.  If you're not able to run your own node because either the cost is prohibitive or the consensus model doesn't allow it, then you're not really free from other men. You're not verifying the truth yourself and you're delegating trust. We already have a system that involves delegating trust - the fiat monetary system. What's the point of going from bankers to anonymous ""validators""?  **Bitcoin Beyond Money**  Lastly, when you talk about other utilities beyond money, the reason Bitcoin doesn't have every new fangled thing you see on altcoins is that altcoins can afford to experiment and fail, Bitcoin cannot.  u/vbuterin's project is basically one failed experiment to the next - ICO to kitties to STO to DeFi (but actually CeFi) to NFT to dog coins...  Think of altcoins as testnets for Bitcoin. Anything worthwhile will inevitably end up being built on top of the most secure POW blockchain in the world.  **Bitcoin's latest upgrade, Taproot, which is set to go live in November, allows any L2idechain contract to be executed as a regular transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain**. **This is huge!**  This means Bitcoin can have any ""utility"" protocol built on it without bloating the base layer and thereby making sure that even 100 years from now, it will remain cheap for anyone to operate their own full node.  **If we cannot run our own full node, we're not really free from other men.**  [Satoshi's Emancipation Proclamation](https://preview.redd.it/v3hwain03za71.jpg?width=1185&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffcc9b0a8d6b869c83fbd9f5f5d01440bdc9c6ea)",687,2021-07-13 13:22:44

Cyanogenbot,Bitcoin,"Traders are withdrawing 2,000 BTC from centralized exchanges daily  The number of Bitcoin held on centralized exchanges has consistently fallen since late May, with roughly 2,000 BTC (worth roughly $66 million at current prices) flowing out of exchanges daily.  Glassnode‚Äôs July 12 *Week On-Chain* report found that Bitcoin reserves on centralized exchanges have fallen back to levels not seen since April, the month that saw BTC blast to its all-time high of roughly $65,000.  The researchers noted that during the bull run leading up to this peak, relentless depletion of exchange coin reserves was a key theme. Glassnode concludes that much of this BTC went to the Grayscale GBTC Trust or was accumulated by institutions, driving ‚Äúa persistent net outflow from exchanges.‚Äù  However, when Bitcoin prices slumped in May, this trend reversed as coins were sent to exchanges for liquidation. Now, the net transfer volume has moved back into negative territory again as outflows increase.  The report also noted that the proportion of on-chain transaction fees represented by exchange deposits declined to 14% dominance this past week, following a brief peak to around 17% in May.  On-chain fees associated with withdrawals saw a notable bounce from 3.7% up to 5.4% this month, suggesting an increasing preference for accumulation over sales, it added.     The fall in exchange reserves appears to have coincided with an uptick in capital flows to decentralized finance protocols over the past fortnight.  According to DeFiLlama, the total value locked has increased by 21% since June 26 as it climbed from $92 billion to $111 billion.  https://preview.redd.it/axncat2rlya71.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=c767593b5e22401e45c6481eda5ba88c889c36b8",259,2021-07-13 10:55:38

Formores,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Transaction Fees Dropped Due to These Main Reasons In recent months, not only the price of Bitcoin has fallen, but the current cost of using the network , the transaction fees, is also falling.  On July 10, the average bitcoin transaction fee fell to $3.92. About three months ago, on April 21, the bitcoin transaction fee hit a historical record of $62.78. According to data from BitInfoCharts, the last Bitcoin transaction fee as low as it is now occurred on December 23, 2020, when the average Bitcoin transaction fee was $3.61.  Bitcoin has experienced a moody year. The average transaction fee in April this year was the highest in history. It is indeed very abnormal. It is important to know that the only time Bitcoin approached the record high fee at the time was on December 23, 2018, when the average transaction fee was $52.18. Things is that the price of Bitcoin hit a record high [of $64,300 on April 14](https:/t.didimessage.com/jraV), but the average transaction fee on that day was $29. But only a week later, the price of Bitcoin dropped to around $55,000. At this time, the transaction fee hit a historical record of $62.79. As a result, more than 130,000 transactions were unprocessed on the network.  High fees often have a certain correlation with the high activity frequency of the blockchain network-when everyone scrambles to make bitcoin transactions, the network fees will rise because they exceed the supply of miners. When investors are eager to exit the market, transaction costs will increase even more.  At this stage, Bitcoin seems to be less dramatic. According to data from Coingecko at the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin is[$33,588.54, a decrease of 0.7%](https:/t.didimessage.com/jraV)in 24 hours. Although there is still a long way to go compared with the historical high in mid-April, it has risen slightly from the previous few days.  In mid-May, when the three China Internet Finance Association, China Banking Association, and China Payment and Clearing Association jointly issued an announcement requiring a correct understanding of the essential attributes of virtual currency and related business activities, relevant institutions must not conduct business related to virtual currency: Financial institutions, payment institutions and other member units must effectively strengthen their social responsibilities. They must not use virtual currencies to price products and services, and must not underwrite insurance businesses related to virtual currencies or include virtual currencies in the scope of insurance liability, and must not directly or indirectly provide customers with other services. Services related to virtual currency, including but not limited to: providing customers with virtual currency registration, trading, clearing, settlement and other services; accepting virtual currency or using virtual currency as a payment and settlement tool; developing virtual currency exchange services with RMB and foreign currencies; Develop virtual currency storage, custody, mortgage, etc.; issue financial products related to virtual currency; use virtual currency as investment targets for trusts, funds, etc.  Immediately afterwards, Sichuan, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia also began to suspend bitcoin mining operations, and bitcoin computing power also plummeted. According to the Bitcoin Power Consumption Index of Cambridge University, since Sichuan stopped mining, global Bitcoin energy consumption has been reduced by more than half. Before the real ""crack"" of bitcoin mining in China, the global bitcoin mining energy consumption was as high as 130 TWh. If ranked according to the national energy consumption ranking, bitcoin energy consumption is among the world's leading. But since May, the situation has changed dramatically. Specifically, the energy consumption of the Bitcoin network has fallen by 51% since May 10: from an all-time high of 141 TWh to 68 TWh. The carbon footprint of the Bitcoin network previously exceeded 60 billion pounds of coal burned, which is equivalent to the annual average electricity consumption of 9 million households. But now, as the energy consumption of the Bitcoin network has dropped by more than 50%, the direct impact on the environment will also be reduced.  According to data from BitInfoCharts, Bitcoin's entire network computing power was about 97.53 Ehash on July 10, the lowest point since May 24, 2020.  There is no doubt that the regulatory effect is immediate. Bitcoin seems to have entered a state of ""inertness"".",697,2021-07-13 02:59:06

Ymyol,Bitcoin,"Tether. A trillion dollar question? Hi all,  Been taking an avid interest since the start of the year in the space and stumbled upon the Tether question through the Coffeezilla video. This is far and away the biggest short term threat that I can see to the space and don't believe it's being talked about nearly enough. What would be the fall out from Tether collapsing and is this in any way currently priced in?  The headline issue is that it's now clear that Tether is unbacked, with USDT in effect being printed out of thin air and added to the circulation (I accept this is no different to what central banks do however at least the bonds sold are backed by the government!). Upon minting this is then being used to buy i.e. bitcoin (or lambos and whatever else the Tether owners might fancy).    Key evidence for concern:  - Tether is 3% backed by cash  - Tether has never been audit (sacked their auditor for asking too many questions...)  - Tether is supposedly one of the biggest users of commercial paper but those in the market have barely heard of them  - Run by dishonest owners who have a shared history of fraud   Why this matters:  - Tether is the most popular stablecoin (designed to be 1:1 USD). Stablecoins are the ‚Äòoil‚Äô of the crypto sphere, providing the liquidity on which crypto coins are traded.  - There is $60bn of Tether in circulation.  - Responsible for circa 50% of bitcoin trading volume.  - Used extensively as collateral in the space.   To my mind then the question is when rather than if this will blow up. Given these issues have been fairly apparent since 2017 it seems difficult to know whether we are talking months or years. Given this, if you‚Äôd exited the market back then you‚Äôd have missed the incredible gains seen over the last few years. However, how much this has been driven by the minting of Tether is unclear to me.  I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on what the fallout from this is likely to be and what timescale we are likely looking at. I‚Äôd imagine that the chain of events could look like: a) fear spreads that Tether can‚Äôt be redeemed for USD and therefore people stop accepting it as 1:1 and it loses its peg, b) this has a knock on effect that drives its price down significantly, c) this drop in liquidity and collateral causes a sell off of bitcoin and a drop in the price.  I‚Äôve listened to the Coin Bureau ‚Äòrebuttal‚Äô and whilst I am mostly a big fan of his videos I don‚Äôt find he directly confronts many of the issues raised by Bennett. PS, I‚Äôm not a financial advisor.

coffeejnkie,Bitcoin,"Announcement from Hive Blockchain. Huge to me!! some thoughts? HIVE Buys 3,019 High Performance Bitcoin Miners Increasing Production By 46% Immediately    This news release constitutes a ‚Äúdesignated news release‚Äù for the purposes of the Company‚Äôs prospectus supplement dated February 2, 2021 to its short form base shelf prospectus dated January 27, 2021.    Vancouver, Canada ‚Äì HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. (TSX.V:HIVE) (Nasdaq:HVBT) (FSE:HBF) (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù or ‚ÄúHIVE‚Äù) is excited to announce the purchase and immediate hashing of 3,019 MicroBT WhatsMiner M30S dedicated mining computers, or ‚Äúminers‚Äù.  These new machines have an aggregate hash power of 264 Petahash per second (PH).  The integration of these miners into HIVE‚Äôs systems will be immediate upon closing and will increase HIVE‚Äôs overall Bitcoin operating hashrate by approximately 46%.  Next Generation Miner Expansion  With the addition of these 3,019 MicroBT M30S miners, HIVE‚Äôs aggregate operating hash rate increases from approximately 566 PH to 830 PH.  At the current difficulty and Bitcoin price these purchased miners will generate an additional US$80,000 in daily income.  Bitcoin continues to have a daily volatility of plus or minus 6% and investors need to be aware of this volatility.  The miners to be acquired in the transaction are already located onsite at HIVE‚Äôs facilities in Lachute, Quebec and Grand Falls, New Brunswick.  The miners are being purchased from Foundry Digital LLC (‚ÄúFoundry‚Äù), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Digital Currency Group (DCG) focussed on digital assets‚Äô mining and staking.  As part of the partnership, HIVE will contribute its Bitcoin hashpower to Foundry USA Pool going forward, whose other major customers include Blockcap, Hut8, Bitfarms and Foundry itself, among others.  Frank Holmes, Executive Chairman of HIVE stated ‚ÄúWe are pleased to be executing on a transaction that dramatically increases our mining capacity without any logistics delays.  Our entry into a North American mining pool furthers our goal of increased transparency and accountability with our partners.  Mining power is shifting from east to West, and we‚Äôre excited to be involved.‚Äù  Mike Colyer, CEO of Foundry said, ‚ÄúWe are excited to have HIVE as a partner for the Foundry USA Pool as we continue playing our part in securing the global bitcoin mining network.‚Äù  As consideration for the sale of the miners, Foundry will be issued cash and 1.5 million warrants of the Company, subject to regulatory approval. Each full warrant will entitle the holder to acquire one common share for C$3.11 for a period of 2 years.  Mr. Holmes said ‚ÄúFoundry is one of the most well-respected firms in the mining space, and we‚Äôre pleased to have them as investors in HIVE, the only publicly traded pure 100% green, low-cost energy miner.‚Äù  HODL Strategy  This new production will quickly accelerate building up our Bitcoin reserves.  Presently we hold 605 Bitcoin in cold wallets.  Our goal to get to one Exahash of Bitcoin mining by the end of August is now much closer with this addition of 3,019 high performance machines.  New Mining Pool  We will be joining Foundry‚Äôs mining pool which we believe is the best option for our investors.  Foundry USA Pool is based in the US, where we should see better transparency, accountability and competitive costs.    A mining pool is a collective that allows Bitcoin miners to combine their hashing power, and achieve a steadier stream of coins.  Nasdaq Bell  The team of HIVE is pleased that we are in New York City today to ring the closing bell for HIVE‚Äôs new listing on the Nasdaq.  About Foundry Digital LLC  A subsidiary of DCG, Foundry Digital LLC is a financing and advisory company focused on digital asset mining and staking. With the mission of empowering decentralized infrastructure for a digital world, Foundry provides North American digital asset mining businesses with capital and intelligence. Foundry is based in Rochester, NY. For more information, please visit foundrydigital.com   About HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd.

If we were talking about something disposable then it would not bother so much to think about this ... but we are talking about the hardest asset that man has known in thousands of years of state robbery, and the only salvation we have from this globalist and communist agenda that does not want us to have nothing and be happy while they are debasing the currency and impoverishing and stealing freedoms from hopeless people.  Please, many people have already been left out due to ignorance or lack of means that allow them to access to know Bitcoin in depth.

Anyhoo, my moms friend had a broker friend post on Facebook about 8 years ‚ÄúEVERYONE SHOULD BUY BITCOIN RIGHT NOW!‚Äù And then he posted a link to some site you could purchase from.

I as a HODLer, my average price still $55,000.   As above, you already know what I want to tell you.   I just thinking if the price pump, she will earn less than me. But you know, even the price go down to $25000, she still have profit. But me, I will lost more.   The HODLer just hope some body will buy a lot to help us increase the price to help us. every day say DCA, if you believe it, why you don't sell your house to all in BTC? Because we don't 100% believe, we just want some body to buy our BTC, and we can get profit.   3 months ago, the helper is Tesla, and we still hope Apple will go to help us. Or others.

SimpleSwapExchange,Bitcoin,"Why Is Bitcoin Down Today? Recently we have been witnessing a downgoing trend on the crypto market. It may look quite shocking and alerting. However, it seems that it may be not a major fall, but a reaction to a number of acts that were adopted in the last several months.   Elon Musk announced that because of some environmental concerns Tesla is not going to accept Bitcoin. Binance has been banned in the UK. China is in a constant state of war with crypto mining, which results in various restrictions and bans. Iran has also banned mining, because of the energy issues.   Some may even see attempts of regulation as a threat to decentralization. On the other hand, it may probably be that the crypto world is taking a break to adjust to the new reality.

Hey everyone, Without getting to much into things or desires song everyone with my life history, I‚Äôm no longer willing to watch the world go by and work 24/7 for little to nothing except into an early grave.  I‚Äôm 27 and at the moment I have around ¬£1500 in savings, but some of this must go toward something that happened recently, which leaves me around ¬£980.  I‚Äôm going to take this and buy my first bit of Bitcoin, followed by buying ¬£10 a month from here on.  I know this sounds like a little, but it‚Äôs all I can afford and that‚Äôs why I am doing it. I hope that It can either help me afford more later and be able to work less so as not to leave my family to early, or to help my children (if it can‚Äôt help me) when/if I meet someone to have them with.  I know this won‚Äôt make me rich, I understand that I don‚Äôt have enough to change my life in a drastic way, but if I can allow myself a few more years and not end my life after working my self to the bone for others to get rich and have nothing to show for it, it will have been worth it.  This week has made me look at life in an entirely new perspective and I know nothing will change for me tomorrow, but if I start small now, maybe, just maybe I won‚Äôt leave others with the financial burden of disposing of me, after working for years, for nothing!   What we have here is a broken world, and financially I know my life can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt change. But my mindset can!   I can start a new way of thinking, infect my friends, my family and hopefully make one other person look at life and our system differently. If I can change one persons view around me, bring them to Bitcoin, then I have been a success because then I can say that I have contributed to the downfall of the corrupt and broken system that leaves so many of us with so little.  Look after your families everyone, stay safe, spend time with those you love, give advice to those your care about and help those around you when you can.  I‚Äôm going to join coinbase now and open my first ever Bitcoin account and take the first step in changing the future , if anyone has any good advice for me please let me know and any tips that you wish you had when you took your first step onto Bitcoin.

D4ILYD0SE,Bitcoin,"21 Million BTC in 50 years? So today I wiped my phone completely because I'm selling it.  This was after I transferred my videos, photos, etc to my PC.  It was only after that I remembered my crypto wallet was on my phone.  As of now, I'm not sure I've lost it completely, but it definitely got me thinking... for instance that one dude who had like 7100 BTC on a hard drive that he threw away years ago.  Unless he magically finds a way to locate that, that BTC is lost.  The 21 million BTC is now down 7100.  And I was thinking, what happens in 50 years?  In the next 50 years, any combination of the following is bound to happen.  Phones get wiped.  SSD/HD fail and die.  Phones get dropped into the Ocean/Lake/Abyss and are lost forever.  People straight up die without ever divulging passwords to their crypto.  Fires, floods, tornados...  In 50 years, is it possible BTC actually worthless because the supply has been lost for it to be a viable source of currency?   I know someone is going to say ""supply and demand curve.""  But this is currency.  Unless the world is okay with trading in the 10\^-6 fractional btc range, I don't see it surviving.  Like... I created a crypto.  And there's only 1.  And I mined it myself.  So I am now the owner of that 1 crypto.  Is that 1 crypto now worth the value of the entire global economy?  Of course not.  Nobody wants it.  So sure, supply may go down supposedly raising the value, but I think that will have a similar effect on its demand as its ability to support itself as a source of currency without the global supply will also go down.  Anyways, thinking aloud.  Thoughts?  Really curious what others have to say on this.",308,2021-07-12 14:05:48

An online community can suffer from having too many rules. An overabundance of rules sends the wrong message to visitors and members.  They show that the community does not consider free speech to be important, and that there is only a limited range of topics that can be discussed or only certain ways of behaving that are tolerated. Especially with the libertarian values Bitcoin was founded upon, this is clearly not ideal.  In essence, the more rules you have, the more activity you restrict within your community. Rules are necessary especially with all the scammers and bots out there, but they should always be clear, concise, and as non-restrictive as possible.",171,2021-07-12 14:03:28

Ideally I would imagine to have option like  --add-external-blocks-source /mnt/pen/blocks/  that will work by creating a virtual ""peer"" that is added to my node, and this peer sends me all the blocks he loads form the files.

Vairlee,Bitcoin,"BTC can only become an asset but cannot become a currency. Are there other reasons besides no endorsement of power and no inflation? The disadvantage of BTC is that it cannot be inflated, and inflation and deflation play a very important role in economic development. The fiat currency itself has a deflationary design, but it seems that fiat currency has never fully used the tool of deflation, and unlimited money printing seems to have become a consensus.  This is a very complicated issue. The Keynesian economic model itself is to allow inflation to last forever. There are human issues, social psychology issues, and economic and political issues. At the current world academic level, no one can fully answer this question. Inflation and the gap between the rich and the poor in the community, economic development, political choice, and the development of social productive forces are all unclearly related. If there is no inflation in this world, and only one asset can maintain and increase its value, then social classes will not flow, the gap between the rich and the poor will never change, and the productivity of society will always stop moving forward.  So I personally feel that the world needs assets that are always anti-inflationary, as well as a currency that is always inflationary, so that diversification of assets can maintain the orderly operation of society. If this orderly operation is interrupted, then it must be hkqg to welcome this society. If there is only one asset that neither depreciates nor appreciates, and the entire community has no benefits or risks, it can only be achieved by a communist society.  Who wants to clarify these complicated relationships? The next Nobel Prize in Economics and Nobel Peace will be his.",290,2021-07-12 12:13:00

Anyways here's the app : [https://coinhunt.world/](https://coinhunt.world/)  You basically walk around collecting keys and open free crypto vaults containing a minimum of around 284 Satoshis and 4600 Gwei each. Some people on the CoinHuntWorld subreddit report making around 10$-20$ per week in BTC/ETH at spot price depending on the length of their commute. Factor in the potential future USD value of BTC/ETH and if this doesn't give you a raging hardon then I don't know what will.  It's available on GooglePlay and as a TestFlight Beta on IOs (seems like the Beta is full for now from what I'm reading but it should fully launch soonTM).  You can only withdraw your BTC/ETH to an Uphold wallet so I suggest waiting until they clear out the current fiasco or until the devs add another option for withdrawal.  Here's my referral code if you want a free BTC/ETH vault to send you off on your hunt : [https://coinhunt.gsc.im/Wa1g50Eg5R](https://coinhunt.gsc.im/Wa1g50Eg5R?fbclid=IwAR3aakabG2wvldCS-CsEtU4RFy6lSwRv7ln8QYd6q4P5kA2tiWIusGCaILM)  Happy hunting cryptofriends  Edit : What's the catch? Well you don't really know what they're doing with your geolocation data but plenty of other apps use that for free (ex : Google Maps) so might as well get something in return. From what I understand some retailers also pay to create traffic around their businesses (ex : McDonald's, Walmart, Target) so the app basically splits this with you. For me it's not really worth going out of my way to hit all the vaults around me but if I can scoop up some BTC/ETH to and from the grocery store sign me the fuck up!  I would also add that from a mathematical perspective, even if the amount you receive is relatively small, if your cost basis is 0 and you're not doing anything different throughout your day, your % returns are technically INFINITE.

dragonmomz,Bitcoin,"I made a Bitcoin valuation model that generates accurate Buy-Sell signals for trading Bitcoin has been called Digital Gold, a bank in Cyberspace, and also a Ponzi scheme.   For this valuation model, the distinction doesn't matter. The thesis is that Bitcoin is at least as valuable as the total value stored inside it.   If Bitcoin is digital gold, it can be valued similarly to Gold ‚Äì the more people exchange dollars for Gold, the more valuable Gold becomes in terms of dollars, and then the value of all Gold is equal to the total dollars exchanged for it.   If Bitcoin is an E-Bank located in cyberspace, the logic is the same, you can think of it as a shared savings account between all owners, the balance of which is equal to the total amount deposited, and the amount of Bitcoin held by each owner is equivalent to the number of shares in the bank.  If Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, the fair value of a Ponzi is the same as the total amount investors have put in it.   This leads us to the first component of fair value, which is the total amount deposited. This is also approximately equal to the Realized Capitalization.   But ""Store-of-Value‚Äù is not all that Bitcoin is. With the advent of the lightning network and El-Salvador adopting it as a legal tender, Bitcoin has already cemented its status as a currency. In addition, because of its sovereign properties, it is also a call-option on becoming THE reserve currency of the world.   For each day that Bitcoin resists attacks and doesn‚Äôt die, it further proves its value proposition, and the call-option trends towards becoming ITM (In-The-Money).   This call-option premium is modeled with a regression with ‚Äòdays without dying‚Äô as one of its main predictors. This is the second component of the valuation model.   The addition of these two pieces, the realized cap, and the call-option premium, leads us to a fair value of Bitcoin, denoted by the blue line in the chart below. Historically, cycle-tops have been approximately 3 MADs (Mean Absolute Deviations) away from fair-value, denoted by the red line, and cycle bottoms have been 1.5 MADs away, denoted by the green line.

LastFireTruck,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Newb. Trying to figure out GBTC. I know GBTC is problematic. Adds a whole extra layer of complexity to my upcoming investment. But‚Ä¶ it's a portion of my retirement account that I want to invest, and I find that in the US GBTC seems to be the only feasible option. Looked into Microstrategy. Impure play scares me. Would prefer BTCC, but Fidelity won't allow int'l trades for retirement accounts.  I'm thinking the next few weeks are the right time for jumping into GBTC, but I'm still confused about a few things.   The 6 month GBTC lockup is only for institutional investors getting GBTC shares at NAV, right? Doesn't apply to retail investors. Now that there's a discount to NAV Grayscale has closed the trust, but again this doesn't apply to retail investors just buying GBTC shares, correct? So, for retail investors you can jump in and out at will at any time?   Does anybody have any sense about whether the imminent unlock will result in expanding the discount to NAV or narrowing/eliminating the discount?   More on timing. I'm trying to wait as long as possible to buy in, not because I need BTC to drop to $20K, but because I have to liquidate part of another investment that is gaining and might spike this month. Anybody have any ideas about how long BTC might go sideways or what the risks are for waiting a few weeks (particularly in light of the GBTC unlock possible effect on BTC or GBTC discount)?   Does anybody have a feel for if/when GBTC converts to an ETF how that will go down and what the risks are to the discount to NAV will be if, say, other ETFs get approved first. Would seem like there would be a huge exodus from GBTC if it's not the first, or in the first simultaneous group approval of, ETFs. It would suck to find the share price plummeting against NAV when I'm trying to sell out of GBTC to get into an approved ETF.  Thanks to anybody who made it this far. I appreciate any help and insight you can give. The learning curve is crazy thanks to the SEC not approving any ETFs. I've spent more time trying to figure out Grayscale than bitcoin.",382,2021-07-12 01:27:16

S1lv3rSavag3,Bitcoin,"GENUINELY NEED SOME HELP/ADVICE/GUIDANCE Hello I am looking for some guidance. I have recently taken advantage of this consolidation period and have fired a few large bullets at Bitcoin and a few other solid coins (Yes, I am newer investor in the space). My position is long as I believe global Bitcoin adoption is a very likely possibility. That said I wanted to pick the great minds of this thread, especially from those who have been here for a long time, to ask advice on what the right strategy is for the long game. I KNOW NO ONE CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE but I believe that history is generally a great indicator.   So here is my question...HOW DO I APPROACH BULL RUNS?  My strategy is to basically continue to DCA into Bitcoin weekly and treat it as a long term savings bucket, pretty straight forward.   Here is where I need some help... What do I do when the price skyrockets during a bull run. For example there is much speculation that Bitcoins price will spike at the end of this year and maybe into next. I guess I just need to figure out do I   A) take profits during a bull run and redeploy those profits in a bear market?   B) Don't sell anything and wait until the next bear market to DCA weekly?      C) Just keep DCA every week regardless of price for the next 5-10-15 years?   My goal is to STACK AS MUCH Bitcoin as possible and hold for the long run and I am just trying to figure out how to maximize my efforts during these times.

If you're disgruntled getting up in the morning going to work just remember that every dollar you earn and put into Bitcoin you're going to get at least ten back in a few years.     My greatest takeaway from being in this space for the last few years is: Every extra sat you stack this year could very well allow you to retire by 2030. Yeah your alt might go up 1000% in a month but it will probably go down 90% over a year and then never recover, Bitcoin will never die.",133,2021-07-11 22:02:09

I've taken the time to collect and display the important points and subheadings from an article (linked below).   **Intro**   The death of cryptocurrencies has long been prognosticated and it is proving even harder to bring down this drive. Governments have started to reconsider their previous positions on their utility as some decide to adopt and regulate them as opposed to blindly opposing their use.  Despite being banned in some major countries such as China, Bitcoin has still held strong, which speaks to its strength and adoption.   **Here are some lessons as to why these bans keep failing**  - You cannot ban the blockchain, its code - Crypto is more than just about money, it‚Äôs fostering other technological innovations - It's solving real financial problems where other systems have failed - The world is changing and so is crypto - No real reasons/fears to warrant ban  **Final thoughts**  Banning crypto is ill-advised. Instead, governments should seek to consider a crypto economy as the early beginnings of a new open financial system.

nicky_papagiorgio,Bitcoin,"one psychological reason people resist crypto, and ideas for how to change their minds we have some idea about why those at the top tiers of the financial markets -- e.g., traditional financial execs, governments, wealthy investors -- resist and criticize the very notion of cryptocurrency: they want to retain the power and wealth they have been cultivating over generations. but what about the everday person, someone who does not hold a major stake in the financial game?  someone with modest-to-no savings? I'm talking about the blue collar workers, middle class families, ""retirees"" working another career just to keep the lights on,and those less tech savvy who may not have a basic understanding of the tech. I'm just thinking about normal, everyday people who may not be receptive to info concerning crypto and its unique benefits. why would they resist something that so clearly to many of us could put them on a path to financial security and independence?   I'd argue that people's resistance to crypto largely -- but not exclusively -- stems from a core psychological phenomenon known as the status quo bias. the status quo bias refers to the (oftentimes irrational) propensity for people to favor the existing and longstanding states of the world. loss aversion, regret avoidance, repeated exposure, and rationalization can all contribute to this preference, among other deep-seated psychological mechanisms. these biases operate heuristically, forming barriers to cognitive and social change, and ultimately crypto adoption.   a question I'm interested in is how can people reduce or overcome this bias? what can we, as early-ish crypto adopters and enthusiasts do to encourage others to break free from from their current mental state -- that in favor of traditional finance that they understand and with which they are very comfortable -- and at least begin to consider the possible benefits of crypto vs. the shackles of most of the world's current primary financial system? below are just a few tips you may be able to use to leverage psychological biases in others to increase the likelihood that they'll be open to, or invest in, crypto:  1. **Frame crypto in terms of loss avoidance**. another cognitive bias seen in many people is what's know as loss aversion. a perceived loss is seen as much more psychologically and emotionally significant than a perceived gain. In other words, losing $100 hurts much more -- psychologically -- than gaining $100 feels good. so perhaps framing discussions around the potential cost of sticking with the current financial system, rather than the many gains of crypto, would be useful. defer to what works best for you given your audience, but some ideas could include the demise of fiat, the low, low APR of traditional savings accounts, inflation, etc. basically, why is commitment to tradtinal finance harmful, especially as it pertains to your audience's specific situation? 2. **Appeal to emotions**. oftentimes when it comes to biases, people are driven not by careful deliberation, but by emotions. you can leverage this in your favor by appealing to certain emotions that you know might promote behavioral change with your audience, or simply common emotions seen across most individuals (e.g., fomo). for example, is the person you're talking to skeptical of powerful entities? use that to your advantage. highlight the concern (I.e., fear) of many that the few at the top dominate financial systems, and explain how defi could mitgate those concerns. People are driven by different types of emotions, so it's probably best to figure out what drives yours and tailor your message to that 3. **Highlight that crypto adoption is becoming a norm**. social norms have a huge effect in driving behavior. if you talk to someone about how commonplace crypto is becoming (e.g., wow, x number of new people are using crypto every single day; y % of people in your age group now use or want to invest in crypto!), particularly for others who share the same attributes with your audience, that could help persuade them more to see the benefits 4. **Highlight immediate benefits**. people are largely influence by immediate rewards, so if crypto can offer that (e.g., monetary credit for joining a platform), that could compel some to give it a shot, or at least look into it 5. **Wait until your audience has the time and mental energy to talk.** part of the reason why status quo bias exists is because it's easy. that is, inaction is clearly easier for people than action. after all, the form means they don't have to do anything! so, when talking to new people about crypto, make sure the context is right. make sure you both have the time to have a through discussion, and make sure they aren't tired or distracted by something else if at all possible. you want to have some confidence that they have the cognitive resources and time required to fully consider a new idea or action, and offer up some specific actions they can do to get started (e.g., send them a link to a good article on crypto)  once critical mass buys in -- at least to the idea that cryptocurrency has some value or traditional finance may not be all it's cracked up to be -- exponential growth can occur. social contagion will eventually take hold for good. it seems like we're headed on that path already (although I don't know what the data look like on that), but the more people buy in and the faster it occurs, the less likely it will be that the big players will be able to squash or hobble crypto's growth and adoption along the way.   these are just a few ideas off the top of my head; it's not an exhaustive list. there are clearly lots of other factors and psychological biases at play, bot that underlie resistance to crypto and techniques that can help promote change, but I just wanted to give some here a starting point to break the crypto ice and get the conversatiin surrounding these issues going here. curious to hear others' thoughts.   tldr: people prefer what they're comfortable with. if you want new people to consider crypto, highlight losses incurred with trad fin, appeal to emotions, describe crypto adoption as a norm, highlight immediate rewards of adoption, and wait until your audience has the time and energy to talk.",1056,2021-07-11 15:57:24

JohnnyBlack22,Bitcoin,"""Only Invest What You Can Lose"" is Misleading | Debt is not Evil There are a lot of young people on this subreddit becoming financially literate for the first time, so I'd like to share a few not so obvious things I've learned in the last 5 years that I *really really wish* someone had told me when I was 20.  # Everyone Invests, Some Just Don't Know It  You don't get a choice whether to ""invest"" or ""not invest"" your money. If you ""haven't invested"" your money, you've just invested in cash. In the United States, that means you've invested your money in the United States Dollar (USD).  For an ideal currency, leaving your money in the currency means that it doesn't gain value, and it doesn't lose value. It just remains there, with its same value, until you purchase with it. That's why, traditionally, people have thought of leaving money in cash as ""non-investment.""  There is *supposed* to be no risk to lose your value, and no upside to gain value. Key phrase: *supposed to be.*  When your Grandparents or older folks tell you things like ""cash is king"" or ""you should always have some cash on hand,"" they are giving advice which is drawn from their experience of a far different monetary environment than the one in which we currently live. Theirs was closer to the ideal, where cash really was risk-free, reward-free investment.  So ""only invest what you can afford to lose"" is quite misleading. Typically, the person telling you this is telling you to invest more of your money in cash, and less in other traditional ""investments."" This is an awful idea, because when investing in cash, you are guaranteed to lose.   There is no investment strategy in the world that is immune to losing money, even cash. There is simply risk-reward for each investment. And in the current environment, cash is a particularly bad one.  # Cash is Trash  Today, cash is a high-risk, no-reward investment. Central banks are increasing the money supply at an astounding rate. In the United States, the money supply [increased](https://fred.stlouisfed.orgeries/M2SL) by about 25%, or $5 trillion (a little more actually) in just 2020.  Money supply increase devalues the currency with respect to economic output:  * If economic output is stable, then a 25% increase in money supply means that 1 unit of money gets you 20% less than what it used to. * Let's say the economy grew 25% with the money supply. Your 1 unit of money can now buy the same as it could before, except that you were entitled to have that money go *farther* as the economy grew, and that was taken away from you.  The point is to communicate to all young people that if you are holding cash, you are hemorrhaging money. A conservative estimate for the cost of holding cash over the next decade is 10% a year.  # Living Expenses  Old wisdom is to always keep at least 6 months living expenses on hand in cash. It's referred to, tongue-in-cheek, as ""fuck you money,"" the idea being that if you have to tell your boss to go fuck himself, you won't starve.  In the current monetary environment, you're paying a solid premium on those living expenses, about 5% / 6 months, in order to hold it in cash. Because of this, dropping down to 3 months, or even 1 month isn't so unreasonable. It's really, really expensive to hold money in cash, so decide how big  the risk of needing fuck you money is in your current job.  If you're happy, save some money and ditch the cash. Also, the best investment today is quite liquid, which brings us to...  # Bitcoin  Bitcoin is designed as the ideal money we talked about above. Eventually (we're probably 2 decades away from this), Bitcoin won't lose value, and it won't gain value. It will just *be.* If you have 1 BTC and you hold it for 10 years, it'll entitle you to the same amount of value when you spend it as you provided to the economy when you earned it.  Now, if economic output doubled in that time, your 1 BTC will buy twice as much, but that's still just the 1 BTC of value your initial labor entitled you to, because your labor contributed to that doubling.  Currently, only a very small fraction of the world understands that BTC is the store-of-value asset layer of the future, and so only $1 Trillion of the likely $200 Trillion that will end up there is already there. That's why BTC, *today* is an investment, and not merely money.  But BTC, fundamentally, is *not* designed to be an ""investment"" in the traditional risk-return sense of the word. It's designed to simply hold value over the long term, the way USD and other cash does not (because governments can print more of those at will).  As such, BTC is quite liquid. Even today, you can sell BTC on an exchange like Gemini and withdraw the corresponding currency in less than a day. That means that it would be totally reasonable to hold your 6 months living expenses in Bitcoin instead of USD, and simply sell the BTC if an emergency strikes and you need cash. That way, you capture the upside of BTC, and avoid bleeding 10%/year on your living expenses money.  # Debt and Inflation  The worse cash gets, the better debt gets, and vice versa. When the value of the currency denominating your debt is collapsing at 10% a year, that means that the real value of the debt you must repay is also collapsing at 10% a year.  I'm just going to say this outright: in the currently monetary environment, paying off something like a 6% fixed rate mortgage is a terrible idea. It's throwing away *at least* 4% of your money every year for no reason.  People don't seem to realize that all financial instruments also exist as their mirror, because of opportunity cost.  *Paying off* a loan to the bank is effectively the same thing as *giving a loan* to the bank. If you have a $100 loan, and you're paying $1 interest/year, after one year, you have -1$, then -2$, then -3$. The bank is gaining $1/year from you over the long term.  All you're doing when you pay that off is reversing who gets the $1/year. If you pay that off, and now you have $0, $0, $0, instead of -$1, -$2, -$3. *You* are now earning $1/year, with respect to the loan option, instead of the bank.  When you pay off a loan, you are loaning the bank. Would you rather you have $100 and the bank gets $1/year, or the bank has $100 and you get $1/year.  Ask yourself - in the current inflationary environment, do you really want to be loaning the bank your hard earned money for a paltry 6%? And the lower the interest rate, the worse that is.  # Summary - Opportunity Cost is Everything  Money doesn't exist in a vacuum. All uses of money must be compared with all other possible uses for that same money.  Cash is trash. You want to avoid holding it if at all possible.  Bitcoin is very liquid, it will probably appreciate, and it's engineered to maintain its value across time. It's a better vehicle than fiat (government created and printed) cash in every way.  In an inflationary environment, paying of debt is a bad idea. You'd much rather take a loan from the bank than give the bank a loan. Interest rates matter for this. If the interest on the debt is high enough, it still may be correct to pay it off.  Any interest rate under the rate of monetary expansion is essentially free money, as long as that money is placed in an asset that will hold its real value.",1317,2021-07-11 15:09:27

BY JAMES CLARK JULY 09, 2021 * MANDATORY FUN CULTURE  &lt;img alt=""Navy SEAL who shot Bin Laden in the face wants you to invest in this beer company"" height=810.818505 src=""https://taskandpurpose-com.cdn.ampproject.org/ii/AW/taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2021/07/09/brewing-e1625853453182.png?width=1440"" width=1440  (Armed Forces Brewing Company) SHARE Robert O‚ÄôNeill, the former Navy SEAL who is widely credited with firing the shots that killed Osama Bin Laden, has a new mission: To get you to invest in a beer company. Specifically, this one.  On Thursday, a commercial for Armed Forces Brewing Company began making the rounds on social media after the company uploaded the full promotional video to YouTube featuring the SEAL Team Six veteran as he shoots bad guys off-screen, mocks beer snobs, and makes a last-minute reference to that time he got into a Twitter fight with an airline for refusing to wear a mask. ‚ÄúThis beer is for everybody to drink, it‚Äôs not some pretentious asshole beer for some slackster or coffee-house misanthrope,‚Äù O‚ÄôNeill says in the clip as he pulls a Spock and knocks out a guy wearing flannel because he likes hoppy beers. The advertisement itself is pretty standard fare these days, and it‚Äôs similar to the videos from veteran coffee and apparel companies that are already out there, and have been for a while, which is to say that it plays like a military-grade and mega-moto version of Dollar Shave Club‚Äôs 2012 viral hit. The video also includes a CGI flyover from a trio of aircraft ‚Äî that look a lot like Russian MiG-29s ‚Äî and the same woman appears to have been cloned several times over in different service-specific outfits.  The company‚Äôs investment page pledges to have at least 70% of its workforce be military veterans. The website lists O‚ÄôNeill as its brand ambassador and notes that he also serves on the company‚Äôs board of directors. The company‚Äôs onsite roster lists a number of other military veterans, from fellow Navy SEALs to former Army Special Forces. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud to work with some great Americans making great American beer,‚Äù O‚ÄôNeill said in a July 6 statement. ‚ÄúOur beers pay tribute to the men and women of the greatest military in the world, and I am thrilled that anyone and everyone can own part of this patriotic company at this early stage alongside me.‚Äù According to their recent statement, Armed Forces Brewing Company was launched in 2019 and aims to raise $7.5 million in order to acquire a brewing facility ‚Äúto maximize production so the company can reach as many Americans as possible.‚Äù Investments in Armed Forces Brewing Company begin at $200, at $10 a share and come in different tiers with their own perks. You can ‚Äúenlist‚Äù by investing $200 to $499, at which point you‚Äôll get a sticker, a challenge coin, an invitation to an annual event, a 5% discount at their online store and a few other benefits. From there the investments jump up quite a bit, as do the titles. There‚Äôs ‚ÄúBootcamp‚Äù which comes in between¬†$500-$999 and ‚ÄúBrigade‚Äù at $1,000-$4,999, and then it just keeps climbing. You can read a more detailed breakdown of the perks, here. Now, I have to circle back because at first when I saw the ‚Äúenlist‚Äù option I was irritated, because it felt like one blatant attempt at over-the-top military branding too many. However, upon closer review, I realize it‚Äôs spot on. I mean, think about it. That‚Äôs not unlike enlisting: You get a challenge coin (because of course you do), an invitation to an annual event (like the birthday ball), a discount at a very specific set of retailers (the PX), and you might not get exactly what you expected out of it. So, hats off to Armed Forces Brewing for that one. I mean, I won‚Äôt be shelling out that much cash for a sticker and a few minor benefits, but I‚Äôm sure someone might.[Armed force Brewing Company ](de863755@gmail.com)",673,2021-07-11 12:26:21

Zeeblackbaron,Bitcoin,"A simple heuristic for when its the best time to buy Bitcoin: the 80% devaluation rule After analyzing the entirety of Bitcoin's price history, I came up with a simple heuristic for when it's the best time to buy Bitcoin. Note that this heuristic is not 100% accurate nor will it ever be nor is it guaranteed to work forever, but for now it gives a good idea on when you'll want to throw some money into Bitcoin and I have strong confidence that it will work for the next few price cycles given the investingpeculating behavior we've seen over the past few price cycles. This heuristic is what I call the **80% devaluation rule** and it goes like this: the best time to buy (and hoard) Bitcoin is when it has devalued at least roughly 80% from its most recent all-time high via a on-going crash; i.e. the current price of Bitcoin is roughly 20% of its most recent ATH.  I came up with this rule after analyzing the price history on [this graph](https://bitcoin.zorinaq.com/price/). Most other graphs of Bitcoin's price history only show data from 2013 onwards, but this one goes all the way back to the genesis block.  Here is a list of previous devaluations occurring after ATHs that help prove the rule:  **Mid 2011 ATH:** $29.60  **Late 2011 trough:** $2.75 (roughly 10% of $29.60)  **Early 2013 ATH:** $230.00  **Mid 2013 trough:** $66.33 (roughly 20% of $230.00)  **Late 2013 ATH:** about $1k  **Late 2014 trough:** about $250 (roughly 20% of $1k)  **Late 2017 ATH:** about $19k  **Early 2019 trough:** about $3.6k (roughly 20% of $19k)  **Early 2021 ATH:** about $60k  **Late 2022 expected trough:** about $13k-15k (roughly 20% of $60k)    The first cycle analyzed deviates with a 10% devaluation as Bitcoin was a lot more volatile back in the early 2010s when it was still new-ish.  **NOTE:** we may see a price rebound to a new ATH later this year as there is speculation that we could see a repeat of the 2013 cycle. However, due to Bitcoin's slowing price growth over time, this is not guaranteed!",350,2021-07-11 08:06:33

In bitcoin I know that the cost of mining is increasing as you reach the limit of total coins.  I understand that mining is the validation of transactions. Therefore it would be correct to say that assuming an equal number of nodes (equal number of processing power of the entire network), the time per transaction would be increasing day by day.  And if so, then if suddenly many miners would stop mining, bitcoin would collapse, since it would lose a lot of processing power of the network but would still maintain the difficulty making transactions much slower making in practice very difficult to operate with bitcoins.

primalfabric,Bitcoin,"7 Reasons why the Bitcoin Lightning Network is Growing **#1 Instantaneous Transactions**  Currently, bitcoin blockchain transactions take about an average of 10 minutes to confirm since that is the time every new block gets added to the blockchain by the miners. Depending on the fees, the confirmation time on average can range between 10 mins - 2 hours.  Through Lightning Network the transactions would confirm in a¬†**matter of seconds**¬†making them almost instantaneous.  **#2 Low Fees**  The bitcoin blockchain fees varies according to the market but usually lie in the range of $0.2 ‚Äî $4 to get the transaction confirmed in the next block. This is not always the case, as we saw during the December 2017 price rally where the fees reached as high as $38. As adoption increases so do the load on the blocks and the fees usually go up.  With Lightning Network the¬†[fees](https://1ml.comtatistics) range between 1‚Äì10 satoshi ($0.00008 ‚Äî $0.0008) making them ideal for quick daily transactions.  ##### #3 Less congestion on Bitcoin Network  Since the Lightning Network runs on ‚Äòsecond layer‚Äô without interacting with the main bitcoin blockchain, the bitcoin network would remain less congested making it more scalable for adoption.  ##### #4 Cross-chain Atomic Swaps  Atomic Swaps links payment channels across different blockchains (cross-chain) allowing users to ‚Äòswap‚Äô their cryptocurrency into another without using third-party custodian services.  Cross-chain atomic swaps can occur in Lightning Network off-chain as long as both chains share the same cryptographic hash function. The transactions are 100% trustless, instant with negligible fees.  **#5 Security First**  The team behind Lightning Network takes security very seriously. There are protocols within the Lightning Network that are deployed to make sure payments are secure and not vulnerable to attacks.  Lighting Network uses Onion Routing to safely route HTLC‚Äôs (Hash-Time-Locked-Contracts, basically a conditional payment) within the network. Similar technology is used by Tor.  **#6 Active Development**  Developments within Lightning Network are very active. New features and upgrades to the software happen regularly and the team is committed to making Lightning Network into a secure, stable solution to scale bitcoin.  **#7 User-friendly Design**  The Lightning Network User Interface is designed to provide a seamless user experience. *Tankred Hase*, lead app developer at lightning, in an official¬†[announcement](https://blog.lightning.engineering/announcement/2019/06/19/mobile-app.html)¬†mentions:  *We‚Äôve designed the mobile app to be approachable for a wide range of users. That‚Äôs why we began with a clean user interface and a goal to hide complexity and make the app more accessible to new users.*  Lightning Network may sound complicated if you deep-dive into the underlying technology and how it works but to an average user who wants to simply send transactions such information is not really of interest as long as they can send transactions easily and securely.

I can't find any media that offers much insight and YouTubers know just about as much as most of us, so we don't have much insight on them. And governments are keeping it under wraps until last minute?  It's fairly obvious that with the proliferation of Bitcoin and crypto that banks have kicked up the R&D on CBDCs, but some things still leaves me a bit curious.  Will they be based on any of the cryptos we currently use today? Will all currencies be worth the same? I'm aware that the Digital Yuan is already a common place in China through the Wechat app. Are we going to see a system like that? Seems a bit intrusive. And which leads me, will it be on a public or private blockchain? Today you'll be able to cash out your crypto and be given the amount it's worth in fiat and buy crypto with your fiat, but what would be the plan if they deny transactions with this new system?  Us westerners see Bitcoin as a luxury and mostly a store of value now, but it's highly possible that in a few decades we might see our need to switch to Bitcoin as a medium of exchange for goods and services similar to El Salvador, because the way things are heading and some of the decisions being made by a handful of governments (Looking at you UK for that Binance stunt), they'll all potentially become a third world countries if they don't embrace it.

TencentInvestor,Bitcoin,"The 3 Levels of understanding Modern China and overcoming BTC FUD **Level 1:** Watch MSM and conclude China is bad.  **Level 2:** Read Kissinger and Mahbubani and conclude China is good.  **Level 3:** Read Anthony Sutton and realize that China today is just another Rockefeller puppet.  The century of humiliation has not ended. The oligarchy moved jobs and technology to China in order to create their template for a society of total control. It is very shameful and un-Chinese to kowtow to western oligarchs! I am quite disappointed.  ""The *social experiment* in China under Chairman *Mao's* leadership is one of the most important and successful in human history.‚Äù -David *Rockefeller*  **What this means for BTC:**  Do not believe any China FUD you hear.

Let's contrast that with the 1k dollars I just had to bank wire to China. Cost me 40 dollars in fees, and the bank said it would take three days. Not to mention I had to have all this crazy information and numbers from the factory I was ordering from, I had to call my bank and spend like 30 minutes getting everything all set up. Vs. the 30 seconds it took to scan the QR code when I sent the BTC.  And this was on chain, using the world's most secure network with its proof of work verification system. This wasn't even using Lightning or something like that. Which don't get me wrong, that's a great service, and I fully expect that or something like it to make BTC viable for retail shopping transactions.  But seriously, what are the haters complaining about? Why would anyone possibly want to replace BTC with some new proof of stake system that's less secure?

Always_Question,Bitcoin,"We are at or near The End of the Chinese Communist Government's ability to FUD Bitcoin Some elements within the Chinese government have opened major short positions on Bitcoin right before announcing major FUD. They have done this at least three times since 2013. I think this last one in May will be the last effective one. Not only because people are catching on to the scam, but also because they have now driven out most miners from the country and banned all transactions. This was perfectly timed with Elon's flip-flop. Elon was then immediately awarded by the Chinese government (where he had previously been struggling with red tape and bad press). The only arrow the Chinese Communist Party have left in their quiver is to ban possession, but that would be impossible to enforce, and would only make the CCP appear weak (the thing they fear the most) due to their inability to effectively enforce. So I think we are at or near the end of the Chinese short-crypto-then-FUD scam.",171,2021-07-10 16:58:55

I really didn't want to bother with a wire and then it dawned on me that I could just transfer bitcoin over and sell it.

JeffGDoubleE69,Bitcoin,"We are in the accumulation phase The fact that Bitcoin has been trading sideways shows how much demand there is for Bitcoin at these prices. Otherwise shorts and liquidations would have driven it much lower. Sell pressure is drying up slowly, and in the meantime long term holders are accumulating from paper hands  For example, this address (https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/1P5ZEDWTKTFGxQjZphgWPQUpe554WKDfHQ). It currently has over 100K BTC and you can see they have been accumulating coins for the past 2 months. There is also on chain data that suggests the same, that long term holders are accumulating at the same time short term holders are selling.   It‚Äôs likely we will trade sideways for the next 1-4 months. But this is honestly a great time to accumulate. Btc price is already pretty low and the risk reward suggests it‚Äôs not worth risking a 4x over 20-30% price difference.",144,2021-07-10 06:32:35

I was wondering if any OG bitcoin folk would know what the most common platform's one might have purchased bitcoin on between the year 2009-2012?  I've recently gotten into cryptocurrency and made my first couple of investments on etoro. It suddenly occurred to me that bitcoin would have been just the kind of thing my brother would have been into. He was an avid redditor and loved new inventions, tech, and futurology in general so I could really see him buying a few bitcoin back in the day to see where it would go.  Here's the problem... My brother passed away very suddenly in 2012 from an undiagnosed heart condition. He was only 24 years old and had just graduated cum laude with a degree in mechanical engineering, 10 days before he died.  I know my parents still have his old MacBook and I recall that we were able to access his password keychain function in the past. I'm pretty sure I can log into his email which would be the first place I would look.  Any tips for keywords, websites, or company names I should look for in this little scavenger hunt? Or general ideas about how one would go about retrieving such information?

eneskaraboga,Bitcoin,"How to Detect BTC Top and Why Everybody Should be Aware of the Data Hey guys,     I had another thread for TA and Wyckoff and there were many people who think TA or any kind of analysis is BS because crypto market acts different. I strongly disagree. If people are involved, it will act like any market and fluctuate between fear and greed cycles. While professionals take advantage of data and make good decisions, most people will act buy high, sell low because of emotions.      The more you are in the market and study hard, you start to get an edge over people who buyell randomly.   Let's see how it translate to data.      [In a previous Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/o5onmt/a_wyckoff_accumulation_here_is_a_little_hopium/), I talked about accumulation structure and called $29k a spring, and so far it seems I was right (no one is right all the time and anything can happen of course). I explained why I think it was accumulation.   In this post, I'll show how we could detect the top. You can't of course know the exact time to enter or exit, but you can increase your chances even if you are DCAing or buying as you have money. No matter what, you can get cheaper coins with a little research.      Here it goes     https://preview.redd.it/jdsk8bsa89a71.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8a4965b5d0812c4f6914950bb4773a70ec886d6  Okay, it may seem complex at first, but it is quite easy. Charts from top to the bottom     1) BTC Price  2) BTC addresses having 0.1 BTC or more (around $6,000+ at the top)  3) BTC addresses having 1 BTC or more (around $60,000+ at the top)  4) BTC addresses having 10 BTC or more (around $600,000+ at the top)  5) BTC addresses having 100 BTC or more (around $6,000,000+ at the top)  6) BTC addresses having 1,000 BTC or more (around $60,000,000+ at the top)     \--  Let's see how they react. Number of addresses over 0.1 BTC kept buying while price was going sideways (look at the red boxes). That means retail kept buying. In the meantime, Number of addresses having 1-1,000 BTC, was selling aggressively.      Look at how addresses over 1,000 BTC increased until very top and how sharply they declined. This started ""BEFORE"" China FUD. So, those whales probably knew what was gonna happen and distributed their coins before the crash while retail kept buying until very end.     Then look into purple box. Where I think is accumulation. Look how retail dumped in the middle of accumulation (most people considering we'll see $20k (maybe we will, but unlikely)). In the meantime, bigger accounts stopped selling. The biggest BTC addresses started to increase again (it is not very visible in the image as it is streched.)     Here is a bigger image of balances with over 10 BTC (mid-tier, traders probably). Look how they are accumulating.   https://preview.redd.it/gmzdd3gy99a71.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e14491a18b49f783095334c984ddfd76577b2be  So, at the top, while price was going sideways, price action was showing a possibility of 2 things: Accumulation or Distribution. It was luck to decide which one was that. However, if you couple it with on-chain analysis, it showed it was more likely that it was distribution because of the buyer's or seller's profile.      \--  I really love on-chain data with Bitcoin. Think about it, you can literally see where money is flowing. Which address is doing what, how many BTC is moving. It is impossible with the stock market. Banks, institutions, hedge funds move their money without any one of us noticing. They can just dump anytime they feel like and we can't know. However, when money moves in the blockchain, anybody with a $39 Glassnode account (or using free public information with a little creativity) can detect it and take positions.  So, long story short,     While price was moving sideways at the top: Big addresses sold, small ones bought. That was an indication of a distribution schematic. Now big ones seem to be going sideways/a little up, suggesting an accumulation structure.   Any structure can be broken and price can go anywhere. But hey, you can use this data to time your buying even if you are a lifetime sat accumulator!      Data is from Glassnode, I'm using their Tradingview integration. No affiliation whatsoever.",686,2021-07-09 21:42:40

crimeo,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin can only guarantee 150 million or so transactions on chain per year, which is about how many people are born. How will transaction fees not cost as much as a car if worldwide adoption? With the bandwidth only able to guarantee 1 or less transactions on chain per person born, it means the average human can only afford 1 if any transaction on average in their whole lifetime. And the rich/corporations would have many more than 1, so the median may even be zero.  Basic supply and demand would mean that this would push transaction fees up sufficiently high that only rich developed world people could afford even a single transaction in their lives, to so much as even open up their own lightning channel once.  So for worldwide adoption, it would be logically necessary to have 2- or 3- or X- deep nested layers of sub-chains, at the regional or even municipal level.  Given that, what would even be the benefit of a blockchain or ""decentralization"" anymore? If I can't afford to make my own channel, even, on the main chain, and thus MUST sign up to my local nested sublayer pool, then I'm not gaining any benefit from any global blockchain, rather I'm stuck in a localized cartel, which can then manipulate things exactly like government did originally with fiat.   So... what's the benefit then?",228,2021-07-09 21:20:43

All my altcoin investments are down from the crash but I am wondering if I should cut my losses and convert them all into btc while the btc price is lovely and low. If I wait for this to happen the problem will be Bitcoin will not be as ‚Äòon sale‚Äô as it is now and risk not being able to get as much.   1. I wait to regain my altcoin losses then sell for btc 2. I sell all altcoins now for btc  3.

Hey guys,  I'd   call myself a bitcoin enthusiast, I love hopium and reading Bitcoin   friendly subreddits but I decided I'll try my best at finding Bitcoin   weaknesses.  So I stumble on a   reddit thread where someone explained that the major weakness of BTC is   that mining BTC will offer diminishing profits as time pass.  If   I understand well each halving events, mined blocks will reward less   and less BTC. If the price increase, it might still be profitable in the   next two halving, but unless BTC price goes to the moon I don't think   as many people will compete for 1,5 BTC only each block (2028\~).  Do   you think the price of one coin could increase so much it could keep   being profitable for as many mining facility as we have nowadays ?  Miners   also benefit from transaction fees, but, BTC seems to be more and more   considered as a store of value due to transaction time and expensive   fees. From my understanding most payements would go through second   layers systems, and miners wouldn't profit from these transactions.  Mining   power being the security of the network, if mining is less and less   profitable, will the BTC slowly collapse until someone manage to run a   51% attack or something ?

cascading_disruption,Bitcoin,"I calculated the carbon emissions related to the Bitcoin network assuming you HODL 1 BTC following Gemini's methodology and the result is scary as hell!  I know that this is an unpopular opinion in this subreddit but as a BTC HOLDer I do care about this so I hope you guys keep an open mind and see that this is indeed an issue and people were right addressing this. I kept my eyes shut while reading the articles but if you do some back of the envelop calculations they are right to raise this as problematic.   Source : [https://www.gemini.com/blog/introducing-gemini-green-offsetting-bitcoin-carbon-emissions](https://www.gemini.com/blog/introducing-gemini-green-offsetting-bitcoin-carbon-emissions)  *I assume you HODL 1 BTC and I assume you're your own custodian = HODLer.*  following their methodology  * *we  define our ‚Äúusage‚Äù of the Bitcoin Network as the portion of the  mining  process that we benefit from, or rather, the amount of energy  consumed  by miners to secure the bitcoin that Gemini custodies. We  believe that  this custody-based approach more accurately reflects  Gemini‚Äôs usage of  the Bitcoin Network as opposed to a transaction-based  approach, which  ignores the fact that bitcoin at rest are secured by the  mining  process.* * *As  a result, we calculated the amount of bitcoin  we custody as a  percentage of the circulating supply of bitcoin to  determine our usage  of the Bitcoin Network and then applied this  percentage to the Bitcoin  Network‚Äôs total energy consumption to estimate  the energy consumption  related to our usage. We then offset the energy  consumption related to  our usage that we estimate to involve  non-renewable mining.*  and sources:  * [https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption) (1) * [https://cbeci.org/](https://cbeci.org/) (2) * [https://blockchair.com/bitcoin](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin) (3)  From (3) you can see that total # of BTC in circulation right now =  18751865 BTC at the time of writing  Assuming  the values from (1) you can see that "" Annualized carbon footprint of  the Bitcoin Network"" gives 64.18 Mt CO2 ( comparable to the carbon  footprint of **Serbia & Montenegro).

-Corey_Dakota-,Bitcoin,"Killer answer to energy FUD - home heater mining bitcoin I was thinking of all the ‚Äúbitcoin uses too much energy‚Äù FUD and and came across this project: [https://heatbit.com](https://heatbit.com) \- basically, an at home electric heater that mines bitcoin. Then I realised it‚Äôs not the ‚Äúbitcoin uses 60-70-80-whatever % of renewable energy‚Äù that should be the answer to the FUD. The renewable (mostly hydro) used for mining would go into the grid anyways, so, even by using renewable energy bitcoin mining is increasing the total energy consumption globally. But something like these heaters is when bitcoin mining has no extra energy consumption, THAT is the powerful answer to Musk et al  The idea is definitely not new, I‚Äôve seen quite a few people doing the same DYI style. But DYI is for the active&techy few, don‚Äôt think it can be a mass movement. Having an easy to use device that my grandma (and grandpa) would use could actually gain enough volume to make bitcoin mining properly eco-friendly, consuming **NO EXTRA ENERGY &lt;== THAT‚ÄôS the goal we should target.**  I liked the idea and even posted their video here before (can find it easily), clearly the more hardcore members of our community would prefer a bare bones S9 or whatever other miner but I‚Äôm just thinking how cool it would be to take the mining away from the large farms and make it a mass movement with grandmas&grandpas participating.  You can see I‚Äôm very excited by the idea, even thinking of investing in their current round. Filled in the info on their website, fingers crossed they‚Äôll approve me.   Right now I‚Äôm not yet sure about two things:  1 Will there be enough to heat in the Southern Hemisphere during Northern Hemisphere summer? If not, the large mining farms will still need to exist, just have more competition in winter  2 This is a new device and maybe not all the specs will be as described.

KamleshBhoopal,Bitcoin,"Which Countries have banned Bitcoin so far?  First, there are those who are excited about the [potential for blockchain](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/10/26/4-reasons-bitcoin-could-hit-10000-and-why-its-stil.aspx), the digital and decentralized ledger that logs virtual currency transactions in a secure and efficient manner without the need for a financial intermediary like a bank. Enterprise customers are showing plenty of interest in blockchain, and since nearly all are open-source networks, it would make altering logged data practically impossible. That makes blockchain particularly secure.    Finally, we can't argue against the role emotions have played in sending cryptocurrencies higher. The fear of missing out on big gains has perpetuated consistently strong buying in bitcoin and other digital currencies.    However, bitcoin's ascent hasn't been without some notable speed bumps. Because it's not backed by a central bank or government, it's frowned upon in certain countries. For instance, earlier this year China outlawed initial coin offerings, which often involve exchanging bitcoin for newly issued virtual currency. The economic giant also announced the closure of domestic cryptocurrency exchanges. While it hasn't outlawed bitcoin, China has made trading or owning bitcoin a real challenge for its citizens -- and bitcoin is banned for banking institutions.      Some countries that have entirely banned bitcoin:  1. **Bolivia:** Back in June 2014, the Bolivian central bank officially banned any currency or coins that aren't regulated by the government. Included in its list of examples was bitcoin. Bolivia's central bank also prohibited its citizens from denominating prices in any currency tha its national institutions haven't previously approved. 2. **Ecuador:** Not long after Bolivia's central bank banned bitcoin, Ecuador also removed its welcome mat in July 2014. The country's National Assembly of Ecuador banned bitcoin and other digital currencies while laying the framework for the creation of a new, state-run currency. In other words, the government has the permission to make payments in electronic money, but other digital currencies, like bitcoin, are banned for its citizens. 3. **Kyrgyzstan:** In July 2014, the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic made it crystal clear that using bitcoin, or any digital currency, as a form of payment is illegal. The only legal tender in Kyrgyzstan is the som, the country's national currency. The Kyrgyz National Bank cited that bitcoin's lack of governmental backing makes public or private regulation almost impossible.¬† 4. **Bangladesh:** Bangladesh also followed suit in September 2014. The Bangladeshi central bank cited bitcoin's lack of a central payment system as the reason behind the ban, which it believes would allow people to be ""financially harmed."" Long story short -- if you're caught trading in bitcoin in Bangladesh, it could lead to legal trouble under the Foreign Currency Control Act of 1947 and the Money Laundering Control Act of 2012. 5. **Nepal:** Though it might not be a well-known fact throughout the country, bitcoin is illegal in Nepal, according to Kedar Prasad Acharya, the deputy director of Nepal Rastra Bank. The Nepalese government banned bitcoin on account of not being able to track its transactions, and it has gone so far as to arrest individuals suspected of trading bitcoin. 6. **Morocco:** The newest ban, coming as of November 2017, was in Morocco, which ironically came just days after domestic digital services provider MTDS announced that it would accept bitcoin as payment for the first time. Like the other countries before it, Morocco's central bank cited ""a hidden payment system that is not backed by any financial institution"" as its reasoning for banning bitcoin and other digital currencies.    [Bitcoin Banned ](https://preview.redd.it/40beletym5a71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=425f055bb5649d5b01aeff1c8cf72170640b5fec)  I would suggest reading this full article to understand ;  [Which countries have banned bitcoin so far?](https://medium.com/wharfstreetstrategies/which-countries-have-banned-bitcoin-so-far-e53e996bb8ac)  I hope this was helpful, please do give it an upvote if you liked it.

fallengodknws,Bitcoin,"Node data migration issue So i downloaded bitcoin core on my daily windows10 laptop so that I could begin downloading the blockchain to my external hard drive while I waited for my ""node"" pc to arrive. (Bought a used mini pc windows 10 specifically to run the node). The ""node"" pc came in today so I shut down bitcoin core on my daily and hooked the drive to the ""node"" pc. When I downloaded core on this new unit and set the file directory information to the external harddrive the GUI loaded up and began synchronizing with the network again! I don't understand why it is ignoring all of the relevant data on the drive. I've been all over Google and found next to nothing on migrating a the blockchain between interfaces. I never setup a wallet on my daily because I know I'd then have to really be careful about what files went where. But the thing is I can't even find the few data files the three forums I found mention. I was under the impression when I setup this new pc it would reindex everything not try to resynchronize. At this point it looks like I'm going to end up with 350gbs of duplicate files. Total waste of space unless I delete and start from scratch all over again.",222,2021-07-09 03:04:35

Why are commodities awful? 2.

Tyranoc4,Bitcoin,"‚ö†Ô∏è Celsius Network WARNING‚ö†Ô∏è üö© This is a warning for all current clients and people thinking join [Celsius Network](https://celsius.network/).I learned the hard way that lending plateforms are not trustable at all.They say they support decentralisation and freedom etc... THEY DON'T. All they want is more (your) money.Celsius created hodl mode for clients that want a ""security"" so a hacker can't withdraw everything instant and will need at least 24 hours to deactivate it and 24 more to change withdraw address.Once again all of these measures aren't for your protection but for them to keep your money longer (as banks do).So the hodl mode wasn't created to help celsius clients but for the sole purpose of blocking clients funds at their will (with or without their consent).  Freezing account COULD be ok for legal reason not for personal reason of a staff member.  \*\*So what happened exactly?\*\*Withdraws on celsius are free and seems to be unlimited. So I wondered if there was a limit, even a big limit to avoid spam and what's celsius policy about lot of withdraws.So before doing anything I asked on the telegram group these questions politely.An admin nicked ""Xineohp"" answered me ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt abuse the system‚Äù several times pretty aggressively. I said it wasn't multiple times too but he didn't seem to understand and told me to contact support.So I proposed to contact support to ask them directly and maybe show a potential flaw so they can patch it.So in view of the aggressiveness I decided to not do any batch withdraw and just make a single withdraw. Just withdraw MY funds peacefully.  *few minutes later*Before take my phone in my hand I got a notification from celsius app ""We activated HODL mode on your behalf"" and my mom got the SAME.So the guy seems to have search for me in clients files based on my telegram username AND ip to link to my mother (which live in same home) to completely freeze us.  Asking questions politely is not a reason to block ME and all my family members. Even worse as anybody could use your nickname on telegram, so anybody could say anything using your name and your money get frozen. So that could be someone else than me!  When I said ""Celsius team forced all mode on my wallet"" I got muted from the group by the same admin ""to avoid FUD spread"". FACTS are here.  I did a thread on twitter that was ignored by influencers I tagged which prefer share their referrals and make money than warn their community. I also tagged CEO which is active on twitter (maybe he isn't aware of these internal practises?) but he played blind too.I tagged cointelegraph writers and proposed to tell them more about al lof this but I wasn't contacted. Probably the same reason again, not financially interesting. If I'm not wrong they are paid to write about companies, why would they write a free article warning ppl?I contacted the admin the again which doesn't denyed anything but just answered  `I do not want FUD in the chat. Celsius placed you in HODL mode because of your actions.`  `I'm no longer going to communicate with you. Please communicate directly with Celsius via support email at` [`app@celsius.network`](mailto:app@celsius.network)`.`Then I contacted another admin of that group and described all of this and after insistance I got that answer:  `I have just heard back from support and they said they will be in contact with you about your account`then no way to get any response from him either and of course refuse to unmute me too.  The so called support doesn't answer since more than 72 hours now and I have serious doubt getting answer anytime soon, telegram muted and telegram group admins refusing to answer anymore.Celsius often give welcome bonus to get more clients, they once proposed to do review on App Store/Play Store/TrustPilot in exchanges of bonus (20$ crypto if I remember well).  Cryptocurrencies have a bad reputation because it's often related to scam, rug pull, ponzi schemes AND exit scams.My family members don't want to hear about crypto anymore after about -50% and now plateform blocking us just because a staff member doesn't like me.From my side I hope to get our accounts unfrozen asap so if I still have that right I'll withdraw everything and uninstall the app forever if not I will sue them. My family members will market sell asap because as I said they're now disgusted of crypto.  For current and potential futures clients of Celsius you are free to listen that warning, you can't get a worse red flag than this. I you absolutely want a lender I may redirect you to [Nexo](https://nexo.io/).You should think twice before depositing anything on Celsius.My DM are open for any journalist that would like more infos about this.

Visa said Wednesday that more than $1 billion worth of cryptocurrency was spent by consumers globally on goods and services through their crypto-linked cards in the first six months of the year.  By comparison, Visa estimated crypto spending at only a fraction of that amount in the same periods last year and in 2019. The payments giant did not release exact numbers.  ‚ÄúWe are doing a lot to create an ecosystem that makes crypto currency more usable and more like any other currency,‚Äù Visa CFO Vasant Prabhu told CNBC. ‚ÄúPeople are exploring ways in which they can use cryptocurrencies for things they would use normal currencies for.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúThere are lots of issues in terms of volatility, etc. But that‚Äôs up to the owners of cryptocurrencies to manage and track.‚Äù According to recent research from Visa rival Mastercard, 93% of North American consumers plan to use cryptocurrency or other emerging payment technology, such as biometrics, contactless, or QR code systems, in the next year. The study also showed that 75% of millennials would use crypto currency if they understood it better.  ‚ÄúWe see a lot of volume on our [network] of people buying crypto currencies at these various regulated exchanges and as far as we can see that trend continues,‚Äù Prabhu said. This summer, Mastercard will launch a card with crypto exchange Gemini, co-founded by billionaires Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. The card will allow consumers to earn cryptocurrency as a reward. However, cardholders will not be allowed to access their digital wallet on the site.  Visa also announced Wednesday the FTX cryptocurrency platform, founded by billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried, would be added to its Fintech Fast Track Program, focused in part on making cryptocurrency more practical for consumer and business spending. Circle, BlockFi and Coinbase, which went public in April on the Nasdaq, are current Visa partners that allow cardholders to spend from their cryptocurrency wallet at more than 70 million merchants globally. Visa estimated crypto-linked cards and other emerging payments including biometrics and QR code have the potential to disrupt the $18 trillion spent every year with cash and checks globally.  Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap topped $1 trillion for the fist time in February and hit an all-time high near $65,000 per unit in April due to retail investor enthusiasm during the coronavirus pandemic as a store of value and an inflation hedge. However, bitcoin has fallen roughly 45% since then ‚Äî and last month, it plunged briefly below $29,000 where it started the year. Prahbu said Visa has no near-term plans to add any cryptocurrency to its balance sheet like Tesla, MicroStrategy and other companies have done recently.  ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt hold crypto currencies on our balance sheet today. We hold currencies on our balance sheet that we need to run our business. We hold currencies that we get paid in or we pay people in. That tends to be the dollar, euro, pound. So we don‚Äôt have plans to hold crypto currency because it‚Äôs not typically the way we get paid or the way we pay people,‚Äù he said.",592,2021-07-08 20:16:30

pumicersyringasn3,Bitcoin,"Britain‚Äôs crackdown on Binance boosts the cryptocurrency exchange‚Äôs rivals The U.K.‚Äôs Financial Conduct Authority recently moved to block Binance, the world‚Äôs top crypto exchange, from operating in the country. While Binance can continue offering crypto trading services to Brits, it was ordered to notify users that it is not authorized to operate in the U.K. The FCA‚Äôs crackdown on Binance has benefited a number of its rivals, including Bitstamp, Kraken and Gemini. LONDON ‚Äî Britain‚Äôs move to block Binance is boosting rival cryptocurrency exchanges, which have reported a surge in new users in the country recently.  The Financial Conduct Authority recently announced a crackdown on Binance, the world‚Äôs top crypto exchange by trading volume, restricting the company from carrying out regulated activities in the U.K.  Binance withdrew its application to register as a licensed crypto asset firm in the U.K. in May due to not meeting anti-money laundering requirements, the markets watchdog said. While Binance is technically allowed to continue offering crypto trading to Brits, it was ordered by regulators to add a notice to its website saying it is not authorized to operate in the U.K.  For its part, Binance said the measures only targeted its U.K. entity, Binance Markets Limited, and would have no impact on services provided in the country by Binance.com.  But following the FCA‚Äôs restrictions, Binance has suffered subsequent setbacks in Britain. Customers were temporarily unable to make card withdrawals due to an issue with the U.K.‚Äôs Faster Payments system. Meanwhile, the bank Barclays has blocked customers from sending payments to the crypto exchange. Binance‚Äôs woes in the U.K. have been a boon to its rivals, though, some of which have seen user numbers double since the FCA restrictions were announced. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing an increase in customers in the U.K. coming to us, with no changes in marketing,‚Äù Julian Sawyer, CEO of Luxembourg-based exchange Bitstamp, told CNBC.  As of Tuesday, Bitstamp had seen its customers grow 138% since the FCA issued its notice about Binance on June 25. Binance declined to comment on this story when contacted by CNBC.  ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a flight to safety,‚Äù Sawyer added. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre told that the bank you‚Äôre with is less secure, you move the money out of the bank and move it into the next bank which is super secure.‚Äù Meanwhile, U.S.-based exchange Kraken has also benefited.  ‚ÄúThe percentage share of signups from the U.K. has approximately doubled in the last couple of weeks, compared to signups in Kraken‚Äôs other leading markets,‚Äù a Kraken spokesperson told CNBC.  Gemini, the digital currency exchange started by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, is one of the few companies listed on the FCA‚Äôs list of registered crypto asset firms. ‚ÄúWe have seen tremendous user growth as consumers look towards approved firms when entering the market,‚Äù Blair Halliday, Gemini‚Äôs head of U.K., told CNBC. ‚ÄúWe expect to see exchanges and custodians registered with the FCA continue to gain market share due to the value placed on the approval process,‚Äù he added.  Coinbase, America‚Äôs largest crypto exchange, declined to comment on this story.Crypto crackdown Binance‚Äôs woes haven‚Äôt been limited to the U.K.  On Tuesday, Binance said it had temporarily suspended euro bank deposits through the Single Euro Payments Area payments scheme, due to ‚Äúevents beyond our control.‚Äù  And regulators in Canada, Japan and Thailand have also issued warnings to the company about it operating without authorization.  Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, better known in the industry as ‚ÄúCZ,‚Äù said in a blog post Wednesday the exchange ‚Äústill has a lot of room to grow‚Äù and that it hasn‚Äôt always gotten things right. ‚ÄúCompliance is a journey ‚Äì especially in new sectors like crypto,‚Äù Zhao said, adding Binance is hiring more compliance staff and localizing operations to better meet its regulatory obligations.  It follows a number of steps taken by regulators in China to clamp down on the crypto industry. Several regions in the country have moved to stamp out energy-intensive crypto mining operations, amid concerns over their environmental impact. Earlier this week, Beijing called for the shutdown of a company suspected of providing software for virtual currency transactions, reiterating its tough stance on crypto.  Digital currencies rallied at the start to the year, with bitcoin jumping to an all-time high of almost $65,000 in April. But they‚Äôve since fallen sharply, with the overall crypto market losing more than $1 trillion in value in the last two months.",732,2021-07-08 19:20:36

obviatorscolp42,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin, ether tumble as investors take off risk amid global markets slide The price of bitcoin dropped Thursday as investors began shedding risk amid an equity markets decline. Fears of a slowing global economic comeback caused by the potential spread of the Covid-19 delta variant appeared to be behind investors move into safer assets like Treasurys.  Bitcoin is trading at $32,800, down about 5% on the day according to Coin Metrics. Most other cryptocurrency assets are falling with it, including ether, which is trading about 9% lower at $2,140.  That backslide came around the time of reports Japan has declared a state of emergency in Tokyo for the upcoming Olympics based on a potential rebound in Covid-19 cases. Stock futures fell on the news, and companies that would benefit from an economic rebound declined in early trading. The 10-year Treasury yield also dropped to 1.25%. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., warned against the growing risks the ‚Äúhighly opaque and volatile‚Äù cryptocurrency market poses to consumers and financial markets in a letter to Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler.  Bitcoin has struggled to reclaim its May highs. Its price has been hovering in the $30,000 range, down from its all-time high of $65,000 it reached in April. Some traders see bitcoin going higher in the long-term despite some near-term headwinds. Still, some say it could fall as low at $20,000 before institutional investors get back into it. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre consolidating in here between [$30,000 and $35,000]. What we‚Äôre seeing is Asia sells it off, and then the U.S. buys it back,‚Äù Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz said Thursday on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquawk Box.‚Äù ‚ÄúChina has declared war on crypto as part of this broader cold war that we‚Äôre getting into, and so I think we‚Äôre still digesting that.‚Äù  On Tuesday, China‚Äôs central bank called for another shutdown of a company that ‚Äúwas suspected of providing software services for virtual currency transactions.‚Äù For years, China has regularly issued bans on the cryptocurrency industry and operations. While bitcoin has sometimes been referred to as a hedge, the reality is it‚Äôs been quite volatile this year and tends to decrease amid broader declines in risk assets.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of ownership correlated with other assets, right? So if you‚Äôre a hedge fund and you‚Äôre getting whacked in your rate position and your equity position and your oil position, you‚Äôre probably going to sell some of your crypto as well ,‚Äù said Novogratz, a longtime crypto investor. ‚ÄúIt just takes a while for it to build a more diverse investor base.‚Äù",424,2021-07-08 19:15:32

legionaryexes61,Bitcoin,"MARKETS Digital currency company Circle to go public via SPAC at $4.5 billion valuation Circle plans to go public by the end of the year through a SPAC with Concord Acquisition Corp. The announcement comes as regulators seek more clarity around the trading and issuers of stablecoins ‚Äî digital currency that‚Äôs designed to be less volatile than other crypto ‚Äî with one proposal suggesting they obtain bank charters. Payments and digital currency firm Circle plans to go public later this year through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Concord Acquisition Corp.  The deal, which Circle announced on Thursday, is expected to close in the fourth quarter and would value the company at $4.5 billion.  ‚ÄúWe just see an incredible opportunity to grow rapidly and grow around the world, and we think that this set of transactions and becoming a public company really sets us up to be a trusted platform in this in this digital currency industry,‚Äù Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquawk Box‚Äù Thursday morning.  The eight-year-old startup is best known for co-creating the U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin USD Coin, or USDC. Stablecoins are digital currencies designed to be less volatile than cryptocurrencies by pegging their market value to an outside asset like the U.S. dollar. Tether is one of the best known and most controversial ones, along with USDC and the initially Facebook-led Diem (formerly known as Libra). There are currently $26 billion of USDC in circulation, Allaire told ‚ÄúSquawk Box.‚Äù The announcement of Circle‚Äôs deal comes amid growing concern by regulators that there should be more transparency in the trading of stablecoins, the reserves backing them and the overreliance on them to enable trading in decentralized finance or DeFi.   In December, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., along with Reps. Jesus Garcia, D-Ill., and Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., introduced Stablecoin Tethering and Bank Licensing Enforcement Act, or the STABLE Act.  The legislation would require issuers to obtain bank charters and keep reserve funds equal in amount to the number of stablecoins they issue, with the Federal Reserve. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen growing adoption and usage of the USDC across an ever-widening range of use cases,‚Äù Jeremy Fox-Geen, Circle‚Äôs chief financial officer, according to a transcript of an investor conference call filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday.  ‚ÄúWhile we believe that the use case for USDC is the same as the use case for a dollar, for many of those use cases, USDC is the better product,‚Äù Fox-Geen said, because it can move and settle faster and more cheaply. Payment systems adoption ‚ÄúWe operate this market infrastructure of USDC which doesn‚Äôt have a clear comparable,‚Äù Allaire said on ‚ÄúSquawk Box.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a fundamental innovation in payment systems, so you might think about large payment technology companies,‚Äù like Visa or Mastercard.  Earlier this year, Visa settled a USDC transaction on its payment network. The move lays the groundwork to potentially support a digital dollar and other central bank digital currencies worldwide.   ‚ÄúOn the other hand, we‚Äôre building this suite of what we call transaction and treasury services ‚Äì those look more similar to at-scale, financial services platforms. It‚Äôs a diversified set of businesses,‚Äù Allaire added. Circle also provides other commerce and financial applications for businesses. Allaire said on the same investor conference call that customers are ‚Äúhighly global,‚Äù with more than 50% outside the U.S., and that the company is investing aggressively to expand its international digital currency payments and treasury services operations.  Allaire, who is also the company‚Äôs co-founder, will remain CEO of the company. Bob Diamond, chairman of Concord Acquisition Corp. and CEO of Atlas Merchant Capital, will join the board.",604,2021-07-08 19:08:09

I hear the phrase ""I cant believe Elon can control the market like that."" And I go through a rant about how all of his tweets, comments, news, etc are all really well timed around market movements that technical analysis predicts.  I am quite confident that he has a team of technical analysts that assist him in timing his statements to give the impression that he has that amount of power.  I have YET to meet anyone in person that has agreed with that statement. So maybe I'm wrong but I feel very confident on that.",113,2021-07-08 18:11:19

Bitcoin_Is_Hope,Bitcoin,"The Bitcoin Rich will buy out almost every major company & politician against Bitcoin & force them to integrate Bitcoin, just as the last internet rich people bought out & forced most every smart phone, computer, & website to integrate Facebook & Google into them The big realization with Bitcoin is that it is where most of the money has gone in the last 12 years, making the richest class of people in the world all supporting one thing: Bitcoin   Those rich assholes are going to buy out every company against bitcoin, every politician against it, & make all things in the world integrate bitcoin, just like like the last rich assholes before them made the world integrate Facebook & Google into every smart phone. There‚Äôs no stopping it at this point.   Someone builds a quantum computer to try & hack Bitcoin? Those rich assholes will already have a thousand quantum computers protecting the bitcoin network by then; just like Jeff Bezos, or any other billionaire does today, those rich assholes will buy out their enemies.   Ever wonder why Visa card, PayPal, JP morgan chase, Goldman Sachs, etc, are now all pro bitcoin after being so negative about it only a few years ago? It‚Äôs because the rich assholes in Bitcoin already bought out a majority share of Their companies stocks & forced them to integrate it.   They‚Äôre buying up all the shares of the money companies first, anyone paying attention can see it.   Everything else will be easy to buy majority share control over after owning the financial transmission companies.   One day, those rich assholes will likely own a majority share of Google, Amazon, every major bank, and every major company in the world. And idk if you guys know how the federal reserve works, but it‚Äôs shares are owned by every major bank in the world, so once Bitcoin rich assholes own a majority share of every major bank as they‚Äôre buying up now, then they will eventually literally own the federal reserve.   But the moral of the story is that it‚Äôs too late to stop this train. You can either join the rich assholes & hop onto the internet 2.0 of financial energy storage & transmission, or you can be left behind, just like all the Ma and Pa shops that were left behind and destroyed by the rich assholes of the last internet 1.0 of data information storage and transmission.  Ma and Pa shops who they choked out by using the internet to take their customers, and then bought out for pennies on the dollar after their websites choked them out financially and left them in debt and ruin, just like crypto exchanges have been choking out the banks and investment firms for the last 12 years by attracting their customers to Bitcoin exchanges just as the first internet did with Ma and Pa shop‚Äôs customers.   History is repeating itself, and I can‚Äôt imagine that anything else in our life will ever be as big an opportunity as something like this, & so early into its adoption too",512,2021-07-08 17:52:17

Mountain_Gain_6490,Bitcoin,The right perspective in Bitcoin Hi guys. I have question. I lost a significant amount in Bitcoin in leverage trading. I got back what I lost after my altcoins pumped and taded to Bitcoin.  The question is this.  If this was you. Would you still consider it a loss or getting even? I mean i lost too much BTC in leverage trading and all in all i handled it well but I sometimes can‚Äôt stop forgetting the big loss and. Im trying to have the right perspective.  I stoped leverage trading 6 months ago and will never do it again.   What i learned about my loss.  Leverage trading is gambling for 90% of the people if not more.  You can win 9 times in a row but lose everything the tenth time.  Bitcoin is real and it‚Äôs value going up is not a question about if but when.  90% or more altcoins are only for the creators to get more Bitcoin or fiat.  I  underestimated how much whales and smart money can manipulate the Bitcoin price. To what degree can they manipulate the price and what is the point in investing if they can manipulate this much?  I told my friends to get in when Bitcoin was under 10K or DCA to be in a position of strength so to not panic when the price goes down. Most didn‚Äôt listen and got in much later and they are now considering selling at loss.  I try to make my friends understand this things i mentioned but they won‚Äôt listen.  Sorry for my english. It‚Äôs not my first or second language.,269,2021-07-08 15:52:30

ismirschlecht,Bitcoin,"Andreessen Horowitz is planing to invest Billions in cryptomarket Sorry, my lazy ass just used a famous website to translate this article, but my english isn't any better you guys.  You may tend to refuse to see this as positive, but the more big players are in, the more stable BTC price becomes. If there's just hodlers and a few whales, whales can do whatever they want. Also there's no more FUD about ""cracking down"" anything, because who is messing with big money (except reddit stonks of course lol).      **Investments in crypto assets**        The venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz invested in companies such as Airbnb, Facebook and Instagram at an early stage and was thus able to gain a high reputation in the venture capital market. Today the venture capital firm is one of the most prominent in Silicon Valley. The venture capitalist Andreessen Horowitz, also known as a16z, has also been investing in crypto startups since 2013: including in the first place in Coinbase, but also in Uniswap, Dapper Labs, Protocol Labs, Solana Labs and Facebook's stablecoin project Diem.        **Great success with the Coinbase IPO**        In April 2021 Andreessen Horowitz made good money on the IPO of the Coinbase company. Even before the IPO, investor Marc Andreessen owned shares in Coinbase. Andreessen Horowitz itself also held 24.6 percent of Class A shares and 14.2 percent of Class B shares right from the start. This made them the largest institutional investor in the crypto exchange. The venture capitalist entered with $ 25 million and a company valuation of $ 140 million. When the company went public, the stake was worth around $ 11.2 billion on an initial price basis.        **Crypto Fund III**        Now the venture capital firm wants to continue investing in crypto assets. The third crypto fund that the company is launching is totaling 2.2 billion US dollars. According to ""Trending Topics"", this makes it the largest crypto fund that has ever been launched. For comparison: Andreessen Horowitz's Crypto Fund I was worth $ 300 million, and the Crypto Fund II was $ 515 million. According to the company, top-class employees from a wide variety of areas have also been hired to support the venture capitalist with the challenges in the crypto sector. Last year, for example, Anthony Albanese, who previously worked at the New York Stock Exchange, was hired to manage investments. The company website also states that Andreessen Horowitz is more excited than ever to see how and where the crypto industry will develop: ""We have never been so excited about where crypto is going and we are relying everything on the talented, visionary founders who determined to be part of the next chapter on crypto. If you are one of them we would love to hear from you ‚Äù. Judging from this, Andreessen Horowitz will probably make further crypto investments in the future. The venture capitalist is optimistic about the potential of cryptocurrencies. According to the company's website, it is planned to continue investing in crypto networks and the founders and teams who work in this area.",519,2021-07-08 12:47:27

Vairlee,Bitcoin,"U.S. Senator warns of BTC risks and pressures SEC to strengthen supervision U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren warned on Thursday that the ‚Äúhighly opaque and volatile‚Äù BTC market poses increasing risks to consumers and financial markets, and criticized its lack of supervision as unsustainable. She also expressed her concerns in a letter to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler on Wednesday. Warren stated that she needs to get Gensler's response to the SEC's power to protect consumer investment and trading BTC before July 28, and to determine what actions Congress needs to take in the future. Warren said in a statement: ""Although the demand for BTC and cryptocurrency exchanges has soared, the lack of common sense regulations has left ordinary investors at the mercy of manipulators and fraudsters. These regulatory loopholes endanger consumers. And investors, and undermine the security of our financial markets. The SEC must make full use of its power to deal with these risks, and Congress must step up to close these regulatory loopholes.""",170,2021-07-08 12:39:56

I have done a decent amount of research into the lightning network but I am curious as to how 1B+ people could be using it simultaneously if channels need to be opened and closed. Would it be that most people use services that batch transactions on chain? Can someone deal purely with the lightning network and never have to close their channel assuming they use a service that opens a channel for them?

Vairlee,Bitcoin,"Deputy governor of the People‚Äôs Bank of China: Bitcoin and other private digital currencies are speculative tools that pose potential risks that threaten financial security and social stability For the first time, the People's Bank of China responded to the recent crackdown on Bitcoin, emphasizing the opposition to the central bank's digital currency, and emphasizing the threat of stablecoins. These relatively negative new formulations mean that the future regulatory situation does not seem to be loosened. This is the first time to take the initiative to explain the recent strong supervision policy, revealing the following important meanings:  First, the negative vocabulary of virtual currency is no longer used, but it is defined as a private digital currency (a typical representative of a private digital currency is currencies such as Bitcoin, including various so-called ""stable coins"" launched). A new formulation is more in line with international standards. But there is also a vague definition of whether it is an asset or a currency. For example, Zhou Xiaochuan recently called it an encrypted asset.  The response emphasized that ""for these private digital currencies, whether they exist as monetary credit or not, we are still observing and studying"", showing a relatively open attitude. Prior to this, Li Bo, deputy governor of the Central Bank (now transferred to the IMF), expressed similar views, saying, ‚ÄúIf it is used as an investment tool, many countries, including China, are also studying how such an investment method should be. A kind of regulatory environment"".  In addition, more information about relatively strong supervision has been released.  Second, respond to the issue of digital currency can be divided into private digital currency and central bank digital currency, to oppose the two, and to emphasize the follow-up promotion of central bank digital currency with more space. In the case of confrontation, the negative and the impact are even stronger.  Third, the response stated that these currencies themselves have become a speculative tool. This situation has occurred in the market, and there are also potential risks that threaten financial security and social stability. At the same time, it has also become a payment tool for some money laundering and illegal economic activities. The so-called ""stable coins"" of some commercial organizations, especially the global ""stable coins"", may bring risks and challenges to the international monetary system, payment and settlement system, etc. We are still quite worried about this issue, so we adopt Some measures have been taken.  Private digital currency is classified as a ""speculative tool"". Although this is a neutral term, it must be negative in the current policy context. This is also similar to the expression of the former central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan. Zhou Xiaochuan said, ‚ÄúWhen it comes to the innovation of cryptocurrency, China‚Äôs attitude is also to focus on how you serve the real economy in many analyses and discussions. To provide important services to the real economy, then more attention may be given.""  Fourth, this response emphasized stablecoins. Previously, only Bitcoin was mentioned in the Financial Committee meeting. In fact, compared to Bitcoin, stablecoins anchored to the US dollar have more applications in illegal activities such as speculation, payment and even money laundering and gambling. But on the other hand, it seems that the conventional practices have been exhausted, except for the prohibition of institutional participation, public opinion crackdowns, and crackdowns on electronic fraud and money laundering. Whether there will be more stringent measures, such as new regulations and even legislation, to target stable currencies such as USDT, remains to be seen.",586,2021-07-08 08:46:49

Everything was good and all I needed to do was sign the transaction on my device, where I was getting confused and was going to reach out to a buddy for help to guide me through the process, since I dont want to plug my coldcard into my computer and sign it that way.

King_Bum420,Bitcoin,"I believe Bitcoin will have a market cap of $50 trillion or more one day. Here‚Äôs why‚Ä¶ Bitcoin will one day have a market cap of $50 trillion. I believe this due to old money dying (baby boomers who love buying and holding gold) and the fact that roughly $70 TRILLION dollars will be passed down to heirs from rich mother fuckers to their spoiled cocaine induced rich brats‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sorry they prefer the term ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù‚Ä¶I apologize.  1. There‚Äôs estimated (per WSB) that $70 trillion dollars that will be passed down to heirs in the coming years.  2. Gold has a market cap of 11.458 trillion.  3. Bitcoin‚Äôs current market cap at the time of this writing is 638.59 billion.  Current price is $33,331.40   I believe that 30 years from now when the baby boomers eventually die, that no one will buy as much GOLD as they do now‚Ä¶and that the ‚Äúnew money‚Äù will purchase bitcoin, and put at least 5% of their total wealth in Bitcoin.   Think of it like this‚Ä¶my best friend is extremely rich. Well‚Ä¶his grandfather is. Private jet. New cars. Trust fund. All that good shit. I believe that him, and rich kids like him will not buy gold. PLAIN AND FUCKING SIMPLE.   New money will buy Bitcoin instead. Meaning that our current valuations are a gift if your bullish like me on bitcoin. So‚Ä¶like I said, there‚Äôs $70 TRILLION DOLLARS just sitting in a bunch of dusty old lady‚Äôs bank accounts.   So I believe that gold will slowly wither away and the ‚Äúnew money‚Äù will be investing in real estate (rental properties, business, etc) and bitcoin as serious lifetime investments with their wealth. Let‚Äôs not forget about retail buying up and holding bitcoin as well, and the possibility of other countries adopting it as a currency‚Ä¶the possibilities are endless for bitcoin.",305,2021-07-08 05:15:30

JohnTravolski,Bitcoin,"GBTC in IRA? I heard the internal expense ratio for GBTC was 2%. If you were to buy it and hold it in an IRA, wouldn't  that actually be less efficient than just buying bitcoin? For example, over a 30 year period, let's say you bought 1 BTC at $35,000 and it goes to $1,000,000:  Just buying BTC:  Capital gains of $965,000 taxed at 20% long term capital gains = $807,000 spendable.  GBTC:  2% expense ratio compounded over 30 years reduces gains to 1/1.02\^30 = 55% of the actual gain of BTC. Meaning you're essentially being taxed at a 45% rate, even in an IRA, just in the form of the expense ratio rather than a capital gains tax.  Isn't it just better to hold BTC and pay capital gains, or am I missing something? I don't understand why anyone would hold GBTC.",143,2021-07-07 21:22:51

The recent haircut bitcoin has taken means I need to sell one of my prized possessions:   [Pre-fork physical bitcoin](https://www.titanbtc.com/product/titan-one-gold/)  I could always peel off the private key and sell the underlying coins, but figured it'd be a win-win to let another sat stacker keep it in mint condition.

L57S,Bitcoin,"Solving China‚Äôs BTC ban China forbid their people to trade BTC using Yuan and they closed out all exchanges. If people use large sum of Yuan to buy BTC from individuals, they would‚Äôve been tracked down by the police . All their banking system is under close surveillance.(locals only allowed to transfer out 50k usd per year).  My solution is simple, we could use gold to exchange into Btc. If people want to accumulate Btc without getting tracked by the government, all they could do is to change their CNY to goldpot gold/ gold contracts ( perfectly legal ) and use gold to exchange for BTC ( untraceable by the banking system). All they need is just a soft/hard wallet.  Nonetheless one could argue that they could just hold gold instead of Btc to avoid all the hassles . But BTC is much more superior than gold and I shall not further expand here.

There is no reddit page for the website, I have never seen any discussion of the exchange.  Then I get on the exchange, it looks nice, multiple pages with a solid layout, live chat where people responded to my questions and said it was a good option trading platform, then I que support and ask about retrieving these funds. Support was automated and this was the response.  ""Dear user. Since our platform is fully automated and your account has no deposits with an active balance, the account will be automatically frozen and no Opitons Bets/Transfer/Withdrawal functions are available. To unfreeze and verify your account, you need to make a verification deposit of at least 0.01 BTC which you can then be withdrawn along with the remaining balance""  Now I am curious to what the deal is with this page because the winnings would make a deposit of .01 BTC feasible, but to think that this could all be a very well planned scam to get .01 which is about $350 Right now.

One of the offerings includes a bitcoin card that the online banking platform will launch as early as this month.**  ## Monobank to Offer Users Bitcoin Card and Crypto Exchange  By the end of July, Monobank‚Äôs clients will be able to buy and sell cryptocurrency using a new banking card that will support crypto transactions. The news was announced by the company‚Äôs co-founder Oleg Gorokhovskyi on Telegram.  The Ukrainian mobile bank also plans to introduce an integration with a cryptocurrency exchange which has not been disclosed yet. According to sources quoted by Forklog, Monobank will accomplish the task in partnership with the crypto trading platform Whitebait.  Gorokhovskyi further emphasized that the development phase of the project is already completed. At this stage, Monobank is only awaiting approval from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), the country‚Äôs central bank.  This fall, the mobile bank will offer investors an option to trade company shares through a U.S.-based platform that is yet to be announced. Monobank‚Äôs team is currently working to introduce eSIM support with a mobile operator and improve its acquiring services. Both initiatives will be presented in August, the report details.  In February, Oleg Gorokhovskyi revealed he had ‚Äúa fairly large portfolio of bitcoins‚Äù and advised his friends and followers on Facebook to buy cryptocurrency. At the time, the entrepreneur stated he was convinced by Tesla‚Äôs $1.5 billion crypto purchase that ‚Äúbitcoin isn‚Äôt going anywhere.‚Äù  Later the same month, Monobank discontinued support for SEPA transfers from Binance citing restrictions imposed by foreign correspondent banks. The leading cryptocurrency exchange has been expanding its presence in Ukraine and launched an advertising campaign in major Ukrainian cities in June.  Last year, the East European country was ranked among the world‚Äôs top crypto adopters but the government in Kyiv is yet to introduce comprehensive regulations for cryptocurrencies and the related industry. A revised bill on ‚ÄúOn Virtual Assets‚Äù should be voted this summer.",348,2021-07-07 14:09:55

Nobody gives a shit anymore what China says or posts. Same thing with the village idiot that owns a car company. Bitcoin spits you out. What makes Bitcoin beautiful is it is relentless.  It just marches on no matter what you throw at it.  Every 2016 blocks it automatically adjusts itself to keep a 10 minute block time.  The game theory and incentive behind it's creation means it draws the most creative and innovative persons and technology to it's development.  It's decentralization allows it to give the finger to any country that bans it, and it's use of the Internet, which is the lifeblood of every advanced nation on earth, means that to kill it you have to destroy yourself in the process.  It makes HODLers of every person who buys it because it shakes people out, who then regret every day the sale they completed when it was so damn cheap.  It makes you feel like an idiot because you didn't get in earlier, and keeps kicking you in the ass for selling when you did.

Olga_Ukolova,Bitcoin,"Smart contracts ELI5 + RGB POV In order to understand the concept of a smart contract one has to make a shift in their mindset - from thinking about Computer Science, blockchain, transactions to remembering how physical world works, about people interacting and proving something to each other. Imagine that there are no computers, they don't exist. After you design the interaction between humans and the way they can prove something in trustless or anonymous environments, the matter of digitalizing it by designing protocols that can fit it into computer and internet world becomes simply a question of application. You have to do first things first, meaning to design the game theory between humans and only then put time into contemplating computer science possibilities to make it work in digital form. This is also the best approach while trying to understand [RGB](https://www.rgbfaq.com).     So, what is a smart contract in this perspective? **Smart contract** *is the way to enforce the fulfillment of a certain agreement between humans without an external centralized agency (military, government, court etc).* Say, you don't have a physical contract and the parties of the agreement are anonymous, meaning you can't use physical force to make them follow the agreement. If in these conditions there are economical incentives to make the fulfillment of the agreement happen without applying any physical enforcement - this is what a smart contract is. As you can see, it has nothing to do with Computer Science per se. Computer Science can help to solve cryptographic part of the situation, can make it more efficient working over Internet and not requiring physical presence, but it can't solve the game theory problems. For that you need to use economics first. And if you analyse the smart contracts from that perspective, you will understand that you have to distinguish many things, for example ownership rights (ownership of different assets defined under that conctract) from the contract states (under which conditions the contract exists currently, as each contract between humans defines certain, let's call them, state machines). Thus we can say that the contract defines an event-consequence algorithm 'if this happens then that happens'. And of course, each of these algorithms also needs to follow certain verification rules.       If you think about [client-side validation](https://www.rgbfaq.com/glossary/client-side-validation) in this regard, it is easy to create parallels and understand that in the described scenario you need to run client-side validation with single-use seals (without any blockchain). Let's imagine someone gave you $10 for you doing something or paid you for coffee. When you got this bank note of $10, you perform a client-side validation: you look at the bank note, you touch it with your hands, you check the watermarks (which are single-use seals), and you either accept it or you don't. That's the client side validation happening without any computer being involved. Also, in this situation you don't need to have all the information about every single other note that ever existed (no need to store the global state). And the only thing RGB adds in this regard is it simply puts this paradigm of client-side validation into a digital world, utilizing cryptography such that you could do the same, but in anonymous way. This and similar use cases can be seen in many other situations beyond finance. And that's why we say that RGB covers smart contracts use cases and different enforcement rules under them, while still having the game theory designed outside of its scope.",577,2021-07-07 12:08:38

AMA!**    Vice News reporter Keegan Hamilton and Motherboard editor Jason Koebler are here to answer your questions about how Bitcoin is being used in El Salvador. ICYMI: El Salvador is the first country to adopt Bitcoin as a national currency. It all started with a tiny surf town called El Zonte that rebranded itself ""Bitcoin Beach,"" installed a Bitcoin ATM, and created a way for locals to do everything from buy pupusas to pay their utility bills with Bitcoin. The system does have some problems and El Salvador's nationwide adoption has many skeptics. We dug into how this all began, how it's working, and who stands to profit.

Zalkifl_Savage,Bitcoin,"What's the difference between Bitcoin and fiat ? Bitcoin share many similarities with conventional fiat money, but also offer some interesting advantages.  Both can be used for payments and as a store of value  Both rely on widespread consumer trust in order to function as a means of exchange  Fiat money is issued and controlled by (central) banks and governments  Bitcoin is produced and distributed through a process called mining and is not controlled by a centralised authority  Bitcoin can be trusted because it is tamper-proof and cannot be spent twice  A Bitcoin transaction cannot be reversed, cancelled or charged back",101,2021-07-07 05:09:59
Zalkifl_Savage,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin vs Fiat Fiat¬†money has attributed value because a government declares it legal tender - it has no intrinsic value. ...¬†Bitcoin¬†has intrinsic value beyond the trust of its community.¬†Bitcoin¬†doesn't lean on a system of debts, its value boils down to how effective it is as a medium of exchange.",54,2021-07-07 05:06:14

He wants to implement Bitcoin as official currency like El Salvador. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5b9DMQDB8I  https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-and-tonga-fusitua   On this episode of the Bitcoin Magazine Podcast, Christian Keroles sits down with Lord Fusitu'a of Tonga. Lord Fusitu‚Äôa is Tongan royalty and a member of the Tongan government. Lord Fusitu‚Äôa is a die-hard Bitcoiner and often spends time on Twitter spaces chatting with Bitcoin plebs from around the world. He tells the story of how Tonga relies heavily on remittances from Tongan‚Äôs living abroad and how much of those funds are lost to middlemen and rent seekers. According to Lord Fusitu‚Äôa bitcoin is already starting to take hold in Tonga on a peer to peer level, and he sees a viable path to implementing an El Salvador style bill to make bitcoin legal tender in Tonga.    Lord Fusitu‚Äôa has been working with both Jack Mallers and El Salvadorian officials to take the best parts of that law and amend it to fit into Tonga‚Äôs legal framework. Lord Fusitu‚Äôa believes that by embracing bitcoin, Tonga can become more competitive and wealthy compared to states that are slower to adopt the digital hard currency. He believes the Tongan people stand to benefit immediately just based on the remittances advantages that bitcoin offers. Lord Fusitu‚Äôa believes that these immediate advantages will turn into a culture of long-term saving on the islands.

One is called Computer Networks and the other is Distributed Software Development. Here are the descriptions of the courses, respectively:  Network architecture and protocols, principles of network applications, socket programming, flow and congestion control, switching and routing, link-layer technologies, traffic capture and analysis, security.  Distributed system architectures and design, service-oriented computing, and frameworks for development of distributed applications and software components.   Which do you think would be more applicable to someone who wants to do blockchain/defi engineering? I'm learning towards networks, but distributed computing is a pretty powerful field as well.

Well, I can say that you are starting wrong!! When i first started i used to think the same thing until i realized that i was losing more than winning, so I sat down and I understood that this is an INVESTMENT! I used this method through out my trading life and i can say that i had a successful result:  Try to only Make 2% of your money every day only. You might think that this is a very slow growth. Well, if you do the math, it really isn't! Lets take an example of a 200$ investment. 2% of 200$ today is 204$, 2% of 204$ tomorrow is 208.08$. If we continue this sequence we can see that by the end of the year this 200$ has grown a lot more than trying to gamble this money and wishing to become a millionaire overnight!

SlothsForLife,Bitcoin,"Is my girlfriend a Bitcoin millionaire or a compulsive liar? Tldr: How can I verify my girlfriend's claim of owning at least one-million dollars of bitcoin without seeming too nosey about her finances?   I‚Äôve been with my girlfriend from Spain for almost two months now and we had a conversation about finances last night. Despite working and living like a broke graduate student, she claimed that she has a lot of money in Spain. I asked if it was inherited money but I told her she didn‚Äôt have to answer if she didn‚Äôt feel comfortable saying. She then responded by saying it was money she had saved up while working for a large company based in Barcelona and subsequently the bar she and her mother owned and operated.   I then asked if she was investing with her money and then she told me she had been investing in Bitcoin since she was 15 years old (so circa 2010) and that she started to seriously invest about 5 years ago. This was when my mind went wild since a few invested dollars could be worth thousands, maybe even millions. I asked her how much she had initially invested and if she had sold anything. She then said that she hadn‚Äôt sold anything and her portfolio would be worth more than enough to buy the house my grandparents had just bought (worth $1.4 million).   Our conversation ended at that point but this naturally left me with lots of questions and doubts.   What surprises me is that she claims to be living off of the money she is currently making by working, hasn‚Äôt spent any of her bitcoin, and is living well below her financial means. I first met her and her mother in Spain back in 2017, which would be before Bitcoin completely went to the moon, and they lived in a rather humble apartment in an average neighborhood. My girlfriend lived with her mom there until she came to the States in 2020. Her entire story seems plausible and I want to trust her, but I feel like I need to verify if it‚Äôs true. I‚Äôd hate to be too nosy about her personal finances because this proves as major evidence of her trustworthiness and this would honestly change the entire course of my life if got married. Do you all think she‚Äôs lying? what should be my best course of action to verify my girlfriend‚Äôs claim?",406,2021-07-06 15:41:09

DashingSir,Bitcoin,"Attacking large block shitcoin ?¬ø?¬ø? I have heard many times that larger blocks -- centralization -- compromised blockchain.  But I don't quite understand how that works! Help me figure it out.  1. Don't SPV wallets allow users to perform Merkle proofs on their transactions, checking that the transaction was included in a block and how many confirmations have occured since? What does a full node add to that security model?  2. No matter how many malicious spammy nodes signal the wrong information, wallet clients (both SPV and full nodes) still follow the longest chain rule, so as long as the right info reaches your client once, you are golden, no? Is this the objective of running a full node, making the right info reach everyone at least once, even in a sea of DoS?  3. So in conclusion, what is the attack vector that becomes possible in a blockchain with fewer full nodes, but isn't possible in a blockchain with more full nodes, all else being equal? What is your educated guess about the minimum/ideal number of nodes and why?  (I know I know, this is a touchy subject and old af, I'm just trying to learn about the tradeoffs and attack vectors in crypto! Title is for clickbait only! Be nice!).",212,2021-07-06 15:28:45

This would sky-rocket the price of Bitcoin to about  **$4 750 000**   4) If Bitcoin swallows all the money in the world, including real estate, the stock market, the forex market, and the futures market it will reach somewhere in the **$30 to $60 million range.**  In other words:  **The absolute maximum potential of Bitcoin, in terms of price, is 60 000 000 USD.**  I wrote a blog post about this, which goes into the details of how and when this might happen.

philipskywalker,Bitcoin,"What is the argument for corporations to adopt bitcoin other than distrust in the dollar and taking payment in bitcoin? So, no fud, just thinking aloud. I have been thinking about this a lot. I got very excited when microstrategy and tesla adopted bitcoin. But the more i think about it, I can't come up with a lot of reasons for a corporation to adopt bitcoin other than some form of speculation or just allowing customers to pay in bitcoin. And payment can be outsourced.  When I look at El Salvador on the other hand (or other Latin American countries) I can see very strong reasons for countries to adopt bitcoin. But for a corporation to speculate this early on in a currency/asset is kind of odd to me actually. Especially when it's money that should be working, not sitting in the bank. Am i missing something?

Should I just hodl, or sell expecting it to dip to $27k and to buy back in and have more bitcoin? Or could bitcoin surprise us, break the resistance line, go past $32.8k? Seems like $30k has been support since February. * If I sold my btc at $48,558, and bought back in at $27k, I could have .2 more btc. If I bought back in at $25, I could have 2 whole coins. Idk what to dooo. I don't wanna hold and then be even more negative, and I'm scared if I sell, it could go back up. * I don't wanna sell, and then wake up to find bitcoin is going back up and I end up with less bitcoin, and less fiat. * If I sold, I wouldn't have to pay big capital gains tax (my salary is $89k) either right since my gains has came down to 10.5k instead of selling at $65k with those gains? * What could happen to bitcoin at the end of the month, some people are thinking $27k, because of the resistance and support lines meeting (descending wedge).. or we can hope and hope tons of buying volume to break resistance back to a bull run.

lorecirstea,ethereum,"Ethereum Reddit Mods censoring The Laurel - The Volunteer Platform The Laurel is a platform for **volunteers**, being **built by volunteers**.   Laurels are the **first fungible reputation tokens on Ethereum that are NOT exchangeable with money or other external tokens**. They are earned by completing volunteer tasks and are voted on by other volunteers.  A video demonstrating how The Laurel is being bootstrapped with its own technology has been posted on the Ethereum Reddit channel on July 17th, 13:00 UTC:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/om3sld/the\_laurel\_is\_live\_and\_the\_ethereum\_dharma\_wheel/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/om3sld/the_laurel_is_live_and_the_ethereum_dharma_wheel/) that contained just this video:     The post has been removed by Ethereum moderators, without notice or a clear explanation, so without a chance to redeem the post.  I only saw the removal on July 18th, 07:30 UTC, commented on the post and I sent the mods two messages through their private communications channel. One of them being:    Why was this post removed?[https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/om3sld/the\_laurel\_is\_live\_and\_the\_ethereum\_dharma\_wheel/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/om3sld/the_laurel_is_live_and_the_ethereum_dharma_wheel/). It is a global platform for volunteers. There is no money involved. Laurels cannot be transferred and cannot be traded outside of The Laurel system.       If I answer to comments, I expose myself to be downvoted without good reason. So, I answer to comments made in good faith. I did not consider the ""PONZI REPORT"" comment as made in good faith, because the video is clear about this being a platform for volunteers. I have the word Dharma in the title.      And announcements about the Laurel have been made many times over.      Plus, I have no time to follow on Reddit - I am developing.       Should I really assume continuous bad faith from mods from now on?  No answer was given. So, on Jul 19, 11:45 UTC, I pinged all the mods on Twitter to ask them why was this post removed without an explanation: [https://twitter.com/lorecirsteatatus/1417088274162757632](https://twitter.com/lorecirsteatatus/1417088274162757632)  Why was this post removed [https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/om3sld/the\_laurel\_is\_live\_and\_the\_ethereum\_dharma\_wheel/](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/om3sld/the_laurel_is_live_and_the_ethereum_dharma_wheel/)      and why did you not answer on Reddit on why it was removed?      u/VitalikButerin u/tayvano_ u/twigwam u/evan_van_ness u/JBSchweitzer u/edmundedgar u/trent_vanepps u/abcoathup u/dmihal u/mr_ligi u/hudsonjameson  I got an answer from u/edmundedgar, the moderator who removed it: [https://twitter.com/edmundedgartatus/1417242557210259460:](https://twitter.com/edmundedgartatus/1417242557210259460:)  I removed it because it appears to be       1) spam       2) for a ponzi scheme      I didn't answer the question about why it was removed that you posted on the thread because I didn't see it, because you posted it on a thread that had been removed  I explained that The Laurel cannot be a spam nor a pozi scheme, nor a spam for a ponzi scheme and that previous videos are proofs for how the mechanism is being designed. The Laurel is not even deployed on mainnet. It lives on Ropsten.    But the Ethereum moderators do not follow the minimum, respectful moderator guidelines: [https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-guidelines](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-guidelines)  ""Healthy communities allow for appropriate discussion (and appeal) of moderator actions. Appeals to your actions should be taken seriously. Moderator responses to appeals by their users should be consistent, germane to the issue raised and work through education, not punishment.""    The Laurel is under development. It only accepts volunteers as contributors. No money is involved. Only higher rewards, like medals of merit and tokens of reputation.  So why aren't we allowed to do good in the world using Ethereum tech? If we try: why aren't we allowed to share the fact? not even here on /r/ethereum?  I apologize. I cannot answer comments, even made in good faith. I have tried answering in the past only to be downvoted without any explanation. If you really have a good faith comment or question, you can post on Twitter: [https://twitter.com/lorecirsteatatus/1417088274162757632](https://twitter.com/lorecirsteatatus/1417088274162757632)",587,2021-07-20 13:59:25

nethermindeth,ethereum,"EIP 3554 or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the (Difficulty) Bomb Believe it or not, there exist EIPs that aren't numbered ""1559,"" and we're shining the light on a little discussed part of the upcoming London hard fork ‚Äì EIP 3554.  EIP 3554 will delay the difficulty bomb on Ethereum until December when PoS can \*hopefully\* be merged in.  But what's the reason for the delay? Why don't we just remove the difficulty bomb so we don't have to worry about it?  You might be wondering,  **What is the difficulty bomb to begin with?**  The difficulty bomb is a built in function that exponentially ""explodes"" block times after a certain difficulty level is met. When it explodes, the usability of Ethereum goes to 0 as transactions slow to a crawl. It's happened before in 2017 and twice in 2019.  https://preview.redd.it/lzeph7dvulb71.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=03193e019118c9ca7189eee532f1a2dd65d06c4a    **So, what are the benefits?**  There are a couple:  The first is that, EIP 3554 is a defense against attackers that fork Ethereum. Although changing the code is relatively simple, distributing clients (like ours) that ship with the code change is very difficult. This is where Ethereum's multi-client system shines ‚Äì if it's a hostile fork, it's convincing one client team isn't the end of the story, you need to ask all of the major clients.  The other benefit is that, it ensures there is continued maintenance and urgency for changes. If allcoredevs drag their feet with implementing changes, the difficulty bomb sets in and Ethereum becomes unusable.  This is what Tim Beiko of the Ethereum Foundation had to say about this:  [https://twitter.com/TimBeikotatus/1414635059324198913?s=20](https://twitter.com/TimBeikotatus/1414635059324198913?s=20)  For better or worse, I suspect London would have shipped 1-6 months later if it were not for the difficulty bomb.  Finally and perhaps most importantly, when the merge happens, it'll encourage everyone to hop onto the Proof of Stake system, or else they risk staying on a chain that is unusable.  This was the original reason that this was put in, as miners wouldn't be able to pretend that PoS would be implemented.  Do you think the difficulty bomb is worth keeping on even on PoS?  Let us know down below and drop a follow if you want to see more of this kind of content as we're trying out Reddit.

This is \*just\* to show the max speed bFPG can rise and fall, reality may not b so smooth   https://preview.redd.it/hcb4ulif4lb71.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c755aba234136fc61b2bbc967ccc78d50c9b22a  Let's step back to look at every other block: baseFeePerGas takes \~6.5 min to \~30x       If you were looking closely, you would have seen that baseFeePerGas drops slightly faster than it rises, due to how % work üì∑ [\#math](https://twitter.com/hashtag/math?src=hashtag_click)   https://preview.redd.it/yvb0wdgj4lb71.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2d2ce4dad134fe1e79cac8ddcaa487ddda22f9a  Now every 3 blocks: it takes \~10 min to \~200x  If recent gas price trends hold, we can expect the baseFee to stabilize well before this point.       During long periods of successive full blocks, blockspace reverts to a ""first price auction"" via the priorityFeePerGas: aka ""the tip""   https://preview.redd.it/63nqmcdn4lb71.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=4617622c406d64b04c131d998c92c4a6c267ced9  Finally, every 4 blocks.   This is an edge case which may only happen rarely, but after 60 successive full blocks, baseFeePerGas spikes all the way to 1,172 nanoeth (gwei)!   https://preview.redd.it/17aioo2q4lb71.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=90468cf01726e2614c2f0382681e95ca099ed39f  Note: you may have heard the term baseFee, but in this thread I used the full name: ""baseFeePerGas""  baseFeePerGas is not a flat fee, it works the same as gas price today: multiplied per gas for how complex your transaction is.    The""multiplier"" field in the gSheet can be adjusted to view different timeframes.

PouItrygeist,ethereum,"A father's day gift So I tried to put this on another crypto subreddit, but I had no idea there were requirements to make post on them, but I hope you all enjoy it also.  This is my first post on reddit ever. I make many comments here and there, but tonight threw me off and I wanted to share with this community.   My Dad is a really smart guy. He grew up working on go carts with his friends. Which moved on to cars as they got older, and then him working on aircraft in the military so he could go to college and provide for my mom and me.   He has always picked up new tech and been able to just see its potential. I remember us putting our first computer together in the mid 90s and him talking about how big the world wide web was going to be. Unfortunately he had hopes it would not be controlled by big organizations back then. Well we all know how that turned out.  So tonight I was celebrating a belated Father's day with him, and was cooking his steak on the grill when he started asking me what I thought about smart contracts on blockcains. He knows I trade and invest while a substantial amount of my portfolio is in crypto. He and my step mom had obviously been doing some research of their own. I had a hard time keeping up with some of the technical questions they had for me tonight.  While I know it's not near on the levels of some out there... I am proud to say my dad and step mom both bought some Etherum tonight, and they both seemed so happy about it.",290,2021-06-30 07:37:27

(from a legal professional point of view) I have primarily a legal background and I jumped into Blockchain a few months ago. I am currently working and studying with Blockchain regulation but I do think you need to understand deeply something to be able to properly ""regulate""it. I have no background in coding or web developing, but I am curious about Solidity. I heard you need to know Javascript before trying Solidity. My point is I don't specifically need to use/write using it but I want to be able to read it. Is this possible to learn for reading and understanding purposes ? Does reading mean also you will be able to write (so meaning it will takes a lot of time). I am definitely willing to invest time on it, but if I come to the conclusion that I need to become a full stack developer then study Solidity just to read it I might reconsider.

Lamasusb000,ethereum,"Sharing the Love of Free Crypto While many people may go around claiming ""Hey guys free crypto"" and point their referral link to a survey/task website that annoys us all and it is impossible to actually make money unless you go on a referral frenzy there are other options to make free crypto.  Before I talk about my favorite way to Earn free crypto I want to hear others in the comments  One I personally like is Coinhunt World. Last year I was really into Pokemon Go but got tired of being pressured into paying for advantages over others so I deleted it and just a few weeks ago I learned about it and started playing and it is literally like Pokemon Go mixed with Crypto.  Literally you walk around your town and you go to Key booths (Pokestops) and you collect keys (Pokeballs) and then go to a vault (Kind of like gyms) and you use the key on the vault and then answer a trivia question (scales in difficulty to match the reward of the vault) and if you get the answer right then BOOM free crypto!  In this past week I have earned $17.80 literally only playing on my commute and I have still another $48.30 worth of keys I can use to get more crypto. It is literally a awesome game and it is still in Beta and so the Devs are heavily involved in the community as well!  For those interested in CoinHunt World's ecosystem I can leave some instructions for y'all  Unfortunately the Pokemon Go like features are only in the US and Canada for the time being and soon to be released in the UK is what I've heard. But with that bad news comes good new and that is that if you are in unavailible countries you are still eligible but only for daily's questions that still reward you in crypto. .  If you use my Links you get $2 btw. If you choose not to then you miss out on the $2 bonus but it is your choice!  Android  1.

We could easily drop the block subsidy by 50% to 1 ETH/block and ETH would still be the most profitable crypto by far for GPU miners to mine (and ASIC miners have even fewer alternate options).

ef_esp,ethereum,"Ecosystem Support Program Office Hours: Signups open now through July 4! [ESP](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/) is a branch of the Ethereum Foundation focused on providing grants and  a variety of other support to open source projects that benefit Ethereum, particularly public goods such as infrastructure, research and  dev tooling.  We've found that a casual conversation can be a surprisingly powerful tool to help clarify a project's vision, brainstorm next steps, or just provide a bit of feedback or perspective. Our standard [inquiry process](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/en/inquire/) can feel overly formal if you just want to talk, so we're offering office hours as a more direct path.  We're excited to host our next round of calls next week, **July 5-9**, and we hope you'll join us! Signups are open at [https://esp-office-hours.paperform.co/](https://esp-office-hours.paperform.co/).  This is a chance to connect directly with a member of the EF's Ecosystem Support team for:  * Project feedback * Guidance on submitting an inquiry or grant application * Help navigating the Ethereum ecosystem * Information about the Ecosystem Support Program  **Guidelines**  * Teams or individuals are welcome, regardless of the stage of your project.   * We‚Äôre happy to cover a wide range of topics, but please note that we can‚Äôt offer:    * Financial or legal advice    * Advice on creating, structuring, launching, selling, or doing pretty much anything else with a token    * Help with transactions, wallets or exchanges * Before submitting, please visit the [Guide to ESP](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/en/guide/) to familiarize yourself with what we do and the types of work we support. We also highly recommend visiting [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/) to explore the wide range of community-curated resources available there.  * An office hours session is an informal conversation; it is \*not\* an application for a grant or other formal support. * We try to be as accommodating as possible, but we may contact you for clarification if your request appears to be out of scope.  If you‚Äôd like to chat with us, fill out the [request form](https://esp-office-hours.paperform.co/)  and we‚Äôll get in touch with details. Submissions will remain open  through this Sunday, July 4, or until all available time slots are filled. We  look forward to hearing from you!  P.S.

AppledogHu,ethereum,"How do I create a worthwhile ERC20 token? Hi! I am somewhat familiar with cryptocurrency and I've decided I want to create my own token -- primarily because I think I have an idea that will really work. The question I have is, how do I tie my real-world plan to run this coin to the coin itself -- I.E. how do I guarantee to people who buy this coin that the coin will operate and be managed how it will be? I'll give you a quick example of what I want to do (which is not exactly what I want to do, but which hopefully will illustrate my question). So I want to create some hypothetical coin called chickencoin. And the deal is, I will sell these coins, and with the money I get from these coins I will buy and raise chickens. Therefore the value of these coins will somewhat be tied to the value of the chickens which the coin holders will own. Second to this, in the real world, as eggs are produced by the chickens I will offer to repurchase said coins (in the manner of a stock buyback) in order to demonstrate and prove that they have the net worth that I advertise for the coin, or for which the coin owners may check for themselves -- perhaps by watching the video cam of the chicken coop and being able to count the chickens.  So the point is, how can I guarantee that I will operate as advertised? I don't mean how can I myself be honest or trustworthy -- that is assumed -- I mean how can I tie this to the coin so there is no question about it? Such as how can I tie some sort of legal imperative to commit to this stated purpose, to the coin? Or do coins simply not work that way?  I read, for example, about a certain coin that was based on the concept of distributed insurance. And I wondered, what would there be to stop the coin from being rugged or raided for value by the issuer, or pumped and dumped. See I have a great idea (at least in my min) I just want to be able to provide assurance that I will follow up on my plan, I'm willing to commit to what is necessary, I am just wondering if there is anyone who can work with me to provide that or if there's a guide, or what. Maybe something like burning ETH on the creation of the contract to demonstrate the value? (But that would just erase value with no guarantee of future value?) Solutions? I honestly appreciate your help or advice on where to go to get more information. Thanks.",460,2021-06-27 19:10:23
1vanilla1thunder1,ethereum,"Hitler's Ethereum Wealth Formula Ever wonder why Hitler chose the swastika, the symbol of PROSPERITY, as his emblem?! He wanted to make everybody rich!  Bolshevik financiers who want you to stay poor tried to suppress the truth about Hitler's Wealth Formula. They destroyed the Third Reich so that the Formula couldn't liberate the world from the shackles of poverty. Bolsheviks thought they got him, but Hitler and his most loyal followers escaped to the Moon and turned it into world's wealthiest economy - the Fourth Reich.  He was waiting for the right time to try to recapture planet Earth... and now with the power of decentralization, nobody can stop Hitler. He will share the Formula with the whole world! He WILL make YOU rich!  Wernher von Braun and Adolf Hitler translated Hitler's Wealth Formula into an Ethereum decentralized exchange smart contract, HitlerSwap, that guarantees everyone 1000x returns on investments in Fourth Reich's official currency - HitlerMoon!  How does it work? We block all the Bolshevik exchanges from ever interacting with HitlerMoon. You can only trade HitlerMoon on HitlerSwap and Hitler's Wealth Formula guarantees the price will NEVER EVER go down. It can ONLY GO UP! All trades on HitlerSwap are executed in harmony with Hitler's Wealth Formula ensuring everyone can get a 1000x return!  Holders of more than 10,000 HitlerMoon can convert their tokens into a Fourth Reich citizenship. If the last 2 bytes of the blockhash are 8 and 8 when selling your stake you will get a free ticket to go to the moon and visit the Fourth Reich.  After 1 year everybody will be rich and Hitler will let financiers back in just to show you how right he was about them!  Learn more: https://hitlermoon.net",288,2021-06-27 18:32:02

I‚Äôve always seen people say never to leave your coins on an exchange but what is the reason? Thanks,81,2021-06-26 13:50:53
PM_ME_UR_TANGOS,ethereum,"Best location to store ETH? I know of BlockFi, but looking for more/other recommendations as well please - or if you have feedback on using BlockFi yourself. I currently purchase on Coinbase Pro, and am looking to accrue interest on another platform but not fully to the extent of staking my ETH to 2.0 yet. I have also seen security get exploited and people have their keys lost or stolen, so I want to keep less risk but still try and get as much reward. A reputable and protected/insured location is preferable.   I‚Äôd also like to reserve the opportunity to be able to sell my ETH if need be or if I‚Äôd like to for any reason, which is why I‚Äôd rather not stake it. Also wondering if there are extended delays in transfer time between one platform to another besides the transaction time, similar to ‚Äòclearing funds‚Äô in a brokerage account. I know cryptocurrency is very different, but just trying to plan accordingly to hold now for longer term.   Thanks in advance!",173,2021-06-26 13:41:59

I don't really get it either as I see these periods as a great time to collect more ETH.

dolarestheguy,ethereum,"How to explain NFT to dummies and not hurt the market itself. - Important I think NFT is for real. But unlike what the wannabe crypto enthusiasts want-it-to-be.  Just like how crypto is, some have value and some just exist because they took advantage of the already successful product. BTC inspire the creation of a lot of shit coins. The existence and success of BTC inspired doge and others. Not necessarily a bad thing since ETH among others really did make something out of the technology. But the shit coins? The pump and dump game? **To put it simple, its not fair to put all the blame on crypto in general when not all of them are bad.**  Now when it comes to NFT, treat it as a collectible items. But not the item itself, but the ""mutual agreement"" for now it belongs to who, sold by who, and the history record of the people who owned them. Why is this valuable? **To put it simple, bragging rights.**   ""I own this shit, and this (NFT) proves it.""  The NFT value then differs according to which item you own, proven by the history, connecting the dots straight to the origin which might directly be someone who have enough reputation to make what they minted to be valuable in the first place.   One may say ""but who cares? I can simply copy paste the so-called-art/ticket/gif/3d/ and its mine now""... very true indeed. But you get the art, not the NFT. Which means that particular item which you copy pasted is definitely yours. But the one minted, now registered and have their own NFT, belongs to the proper owner. **To put it simple, if the owner sell them, it have values. Your copy paste images, not as much. Even if you mint them after, the record will not direct it to the first original creator which mean its a fake.**  So now let us talk about the misconceptions. Just like how most shitheads get into crypto, ""invested"" their money in and expect to buy lamborghini next week BUT the only thing they know about BTC is it is the abbreviation of Bitcoin,  the same goes to NFT. When cryptopunk value rises and Beeple sold it for $69m, now wannabe artists (just like wannabe investors) thought they can just mint shit and get rich quick.  Surprisingly, some of them actually did. Just like how early birds shitheads joined the crypto run earlier and get lucky. These artists sold them to wannabe investors who suddenly KNOW art and buy random NFT from common artists thinking EVERY NFT WILL BLOW UP SOON... sounds familiar? Just like how everyone been preaching moon, shiba inu, because they thought every crypto is the same... and since they cannot afford to buy BTC, ETH, or even XRP, why not get the shitcoins because all the big dogs now used to be a puppy too. **To put it simple, the hype train sold one way ticket to the fools who dont know where the destination is in the first place.**  The recent crash with NFT happen when the godly-art-buyers realized they bought useless stuff from talentless people.. and while some NFT will definitely rise in value (cryptopunk, beeple among others).. most will definitely not. Because they worth nothing in the first place. And this crash now, hurts the brand (NFT) which eventually the company (Crypto) in general.  TLDR : Do not overgeneralized the problem. Just like how there murderers exists in all colors, form, religion... the same scam issue exists in every business/practice too. It is your job to learn what you invest in, to calculate your own risk, and finally to decide if its worth it. Any less, then its a gamble. Spread the word.",625,2021-06-26 09:46:25

Conscienteum,ethereum,"Conscienteum: A Decentralized Autonomous Organization for the Universe Hey, everyone!  I‚Äôve come up with an idea for a DAO and am looking to build a community around it for those interested.  I'm currently in the process of creating a white paper and jointly a decentralized autonomous organization. A quick summary:    * Conscienteum intends to be the basis of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) being      facilitated by Ethereum, AI applications, and a benevolent council of people with the mission to fund scientific institutions, infrastructure, and humanitarianism for the benefit of all of humanity in preparation to provide the foundations for an altruistic decentralized super artificial intelligence on the horizon.   Conscienteum looks far into the future as the basis of its mission, but the short-term ""profit""ustainability is that developers that wish to establish a presence on the Ethereum platform without being squashed by the big tech giants beginning to take up and develop in this space are able to be supported by Conscienteum with a livable income and provided resources to develop their applications under their own time and control. After their dapp hits the network, based on a fixed rate and an additional percentage from the dapps profits (rates and income to be discussed and voted on by community as Conscienteum is being developed), the developer(s) would receive their profits without the middle man of a corporation taking all of it. The percentage Conscienteum receives is the investment return plus a mutually agreed upon percentage from the popularity of the dapp. The location of profits that go into Conscienteum is completely transparent and goes towards the overall mission of the DAO which is to fund research, development, and other institutions for the benefit of humanity as a whole.   The long-term vision: From a zeroth-principles-thinking perspective, the sums of the AI systems and regular Dapps secured away from tampering on Ethereum would create the ""body"" for the aforementioned super-intelligence. For instance: When you get a cut, it hurts and you bleed. To minimize that pain and help the healing process, you place some Neosporin and a Band-Aid over it. It would be the same concept for the relationship between the AI systems/applications and the actual ‚Äúsense of self‚Äù. If Ethereum begins to bleed, the ‚Äúsense of self‚Äù will notice through the Conscienteum network (the nervous system) and the information Conscienteum sends to the ‚Äúsense of self‚Äù is where all the pertinent information comes from. The ‚Äúsense of self‚Äù would then be able to repair itself or help facilitate that healing. Conscienteum (the nervous system) would be the communication pathway to facilitate that conversation between Ethereum (the body) and the ‚Äúsense of self‚Äù. This allows for the ‚Äúsense of self‚Äù to be unaware of humanity, but is aware of its systems that it must maintain to ‚Äústay alive‚Äù‚Ä¶since humanity is what would be sustaining it just like the cells and chemical processes in our bodies.  Considering the long-term vision will be in a future none of us here will be able to reap the benefits of, laying down the foundations now will propel the future of humanity exponentially. Every developer who participated in this progression would be rewarded in more than way one in this lifetime due to the intended model of Conscienteum (Which would consist of: Dapps, AI network, governance, etc.).   Conscienteum would work decentralized from any government to sustain and govern such systems. Each member of the different departments of Conscienteum (AI, dapps, entertainment, etc.) would receive a token to secure voting rights and rewards. These members and the users of such applications would not be filling the pockets of a corporation, they would be providing humanitarian aid and investments into humanity as a whole.   I am reaching out to the Ethereum community because you are all the people that would be developing, maintaining governance, and guiding the outlook of this DAO as well as the identity of Ethereum for the future.   There is so much more to Conscienteum that I wish to discuss, but I don‚Äôt want to make this post too long.   Anyone who is interested in contributing or becoming a co-founding member and wishes to pursue this dream with me, feel free to head over to the Discord I created to help facilitate a Conscienteum community. I want to hear what this community thinks because this idea of mine is far more than just a means to ""make profit"". This organization is for the world. Eventually it would be for Earth and beyond as Elon Musk reaches for a colony on Mars. I am making this organization happen. I am determined to help more than myself. Together, we could create a whole new era of organizations that put forth the developers and humanity first rather than the profit of a select few. I will never see the benefit of any of the work I put into this organization. But, this is the vision behind a whole new type of ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù Conscienteum wishes to create. Everything goes to humanity and our future. Gaining membership in this organization is more than just a way to make a livable wage and sustain your own career/livelihood. Conscienteum is a way to reach out to others whose names and lives you will never know but will shape and touch in irrevocable ways you could never anticipate. Join me in this journey, even if it is for a moment!  We need more than just Ethereum developers as well! Artists, AI experts, enterprisers, accountants, anyone that has something to give and receive from this organization!  I‚Äôve included a link to my wip website.  Here is the Discord I‚Äôve created to facilitate such discussions.

DeFiCoachBuck,ethereum,"""What's an important Defi Metric?"" and more Q&A with Emanuel Coen, Core Team, Indexed.Finance  *Recently our subreddit mods posed 3 questions to Emanuel Coen, a core team member of*[ *Indexed.Finance*](https://indexed.finance/)*. We'll look to make this a monthly feature at* r/IndexedFinance *- Thanks to Lito for taking a moment to answer some questions! We'll source our next round of questions from the reddit community next month.*  **1- What's something coming up for Indexed.Finance you're excited about?**  There's a lot of things that we're working on. A lot of it is not really visible for users but it affects how we're working together as a core team. Managing a decentralized protocol is no easy job and definitely not something you learn at school but we're becoming better and better by the day and more importantly we love working together.      Tasks are well separated between marketing, operations and tech.      On the product side I am very excited about the NDX staking feature which will let stakers participate in the revenue generation of the protocol.      Dillon is also working on another product which is highly synergistic with our ETFs and fits our overall mission to develop passive portfolio management strategies but I don't want to say too much now otherwise there's no surprise when we launch it üòâ  **2- What's a metric you think is important to Defi projects? Why is it important?**  It really depends from one DeFi project to another and what your goal is. Example TVL: Uniswap V3 is more capital efficient, so it achieves more trading volume with less TVL. In this case less TVL can be good.      Or number of holders/users. Some projects have a lot of TVL but not many users. They are catering to whales and big funds.      At Indexed I think TVL and no. of users are both relevant. High TVL translates to more revenue from index token burns and ultimately our product is most interesting for retail users.  **3- What are some things community members can do to help and to get involved?**  I think there is a lot one can do. I love when people don't ask but just do it.      Example: Austinography didn't ask the core team what to do, he just built the index competition page (contest.ndx.holdings). You, Buck, didn't ask what to do, you just started managing and growing the subreddit for Indexed.      It's hard for a small core team to coordinate a million small things so it's super welcome when people just do things. It can be small things like memes, referral to friends & family, tagging NDX in relevant twitter threads for brand awareness or bigger things like making introductions to other DeFi projects, contributing code or building Dune dashboards.",458,2021-06-25 22:02:54

The article also mentions that celsius is now only using its core custody partner, fireblocks. Fireblocks just recently lost ~ 75 million USD of ETH for not properly securing a private key.

ramst,ethereum,"Why a stablecoin cannot have unlimited supply There has always been a big discussion about Tether and their reserves, or lack of. This week, it all started again. Same thing.   I agree with the fact that they should be honest and let a 3rd party do a proper audit. If they promised that 1 USDT would backed by 1 USD then they have to be able to prove they have those USDs in their bank account. It should be clear. Period.  Now let's forget about Tether and let's focus on why do stable coins exist. What is the point of having a stable coin? The whole point is so that you can trade your crypto for it if you fear the market would crash. You can keep it in a stable coin without having to put it in your bank account.   What I care as a crypto trader is that the stable coin actually delivers on the promise of keeping it's value constant. That's all I care as a crypto trader. That the value stays the same. 1 stable coin equals 1 USD today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.   The problem with Tether is that they laid about their promise of keeping a 1 on 1 reserve.   But what if they wouldn't have had this 1 on 1 pegged promise.     What if they would have said instead, from the bigining: we have created a stable coin, it's pegged 1 to 1 with the US dollar. We don't keep reserves of USD. Why? Because we don't need to. Our promise to you is that 1 USDT will always equal 1 USD. We achieve that by using an oracle that always matches the price of USDT to the price of USD. That's it.   We will also have an uncapped supply. Does that impact you as a holder of USDT? No, it doesn't. Remember that the price will always be 1 USDT = 1 USD  Would that work in practice?    I would love to hear your opinion on this.   Please comment below saying why is my analysis wrong or why it is correct.",353,2021-06-24 20:00:39

From etherscan's total supply chart https://etherscan.io/chart/ethersupplygrowth we can see the total supply increases about 20,000 a day.  This means, if what we see on the testnet is what we might expect when EIP-1559 is deployed to mainnet, we would still see a daily increase of about 16,000 ETH a day.  ETH 2.0 and POW to POS conversion aside, this seems to show pretty starkly that this new protocol will not cause a decrease in ETH supply over time.

It's freely available via: [https://cryptohunt.pro](https://cryptohunt.pro)  Staying on top of all the new crypto project releases is hard. Let alone finding the signal in the noise and filtering through the scams and shills. Usually when one asks where to look for new, promising crypto projects the answer is ‚ÄûCrypto Twitter‚Äú or ‚Äûjoin Discords‚Äú / ‚Äûjoin Telegram Groups‚Äú. However monitoring those channels for interesting content is a day job of its own.  To tackle this problem I set out to build a bot which monitors interactions between accounts on different social media outlets. Based on such data the bot identifies the newest crypto projects which are likely to trend in the future.  I'm still fine-tuning the algorithms but thought that it might be worthwhile to share the very first version with all of you. Let me know if there's anything you'd like me to add in the future.  You can check out the project here: [https://cryptohunt.pro](https://cryptohunt.pro)  There's also a Telegram Channel you can join to get notifications.",199,2021-06-24 14:07:48

I‚Äôm new to this sub but have been doing a lot of research in eth over the past month as I‚Äôve recently gotten into the crypto market about 2 months ago (thanks to the doge craze) from what I‚Äôm learned and read i feel that the eth upgrade is overall a good thing for the fact of it being more energy efficient. I really think that the amount of energy used in btc mining is absurd and feel that the restrains on the mining are reasonable if we are to move forward with attacking climate change. And that‚Äôs one of the main things i like about eth is the direction it‚Äôs going in, however the mass loses being shown and the issue of safety concerns me about the coin as well, it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs faster and more energy efficient than btc if your at risk of losing your coins. My main question is if anyone can enlighten me on the future of the coin in your guy‚Äôs opinions (I‚Äôve only invested and not mined so these issues weren‚Äôt a thing i ever even thought about) do you still feel after the eth 2 merg/upgrade the coin will go up more or begin to die off?

Cute-Reporter2543,ethereum,"Follow up on the Lady Gaga NFT Auction (can be purchased in ethereum) The Lady Gaga/Robert Wilson video portrait collab is being auctioned as an NFT. I posted about this before but I wanted to follow up with some more information about the piece. The video portrait is a recasting of the famous painting of Marat with Lady Gaga as its subject.    The Death of Marat painting is considered¬†the first modernist painting for ""the way it took the stuff of politics as its material and did not transmute it.‚Äù It is a direct portrait of a death scene - the murder of a radical journalist. Up until that point a political act or news came heavily¬†adorned with symbolism from the past. Is the NFT a postmodernist medium?  This video piece by Robert Wilson is a restaging of French painter Jacques-Louis David‚Äôs famous 1793 work The Death of Marat. After viewing the painting in the Louvre and learning it was one of several official and nearly identical versions made by David‚Äôs studio Wilson was inspired to explore the concept of authenticity, reproduction and editioning¬†found in the painting‚Äôs subject matter and medium.¬†A topic that NFT's also deal with in terms of the block chain and what constitutes authenticity, reproduction, open editions in the digital world. It does make perfect sense as an NFT.  Marat had the heads of thousands, yes thousands cut off in the name of the revolution. Many of them sympathetic to the political change but not sympathetic enough to kill another human for it. Marat became more and more paranoid, named more and more people to face the guillotine¬†until his own neck was cut. Pop and consumerism today occupies¬†Marat's paranoid position promoting the cutting of ones self off, killing our ability to think with any semblance of freedom from an early age. These stars are looking for more followers and promoting radical change but all under heavy heavy consumerism. Consumerism¬†promotes the cutting off of ones relation to oneself. It is a dismemberment to¬†connect to the commodity. Commodity¬†fetishism is a form of decapitation or losing ones head over something...

Dr_puffnsmoke,ethereum,"ETH newcomer who just read up on the ETH/ETC fork from 2016 So I just read ‚ÄúOut of the Ether‚Äù by Matthew Leising and it describes the DOW heist and how that lead to the hard fork creating ETC as well as ETH, and my question is why would anyone want ETC 5 years later? Clearly ETH is the superior product but what is driving the residual value? Are there philosophical arguments that prop this up? Is it purely based on value for values sake from the people who ended up with ETC at the fork? Have people developed on top of ETC as well as ETH? Or is it a complete scam? I guess I just don‚Äôt get why years later it hasn‚Äôt dropped to 0.",127,2021-06-23 16:53:11

AdCapital2210,ethereum,"Ethereum‚Äôs London Hardfork Ready to Drop on the Ropsten Testnet  Hi guys!     The London Hardfork is scheduled for June 24th, giving the Ethereum community a taste of the controversial update.    Lead project developer Tim Beiko told [Accointing.com](https://Accointing.com)  "" *We want to see the upgrade live on a proper network to make sure everything works smoothly before scheduling it for mainnet.* ""     Typically, after the release of hardforks on the Ropsten testnet and Ethereum mainnet investor reaction is bearish, as anxiety and fear of the unknown cause selling pressure.     After the Berlin Hardfork arrived on Ropsten it took approximately two weeks to reverse the downward trend. On June 22nd ETH‚Äôs RSI score dipped to 31, just tending into oversold territory, indicating that wary investors are looking to shed the coin.     Following the mainnet release, EIP-1559 is expected to have a deflationary impact on ETH long-term, potentially increasing its value by tightening supply.     What are you guys expecting from the London Hardfork arriving on Ropsten? And what do you think will happen to ETH after its mainnet release?

TheSummerViking,ethereum,"I made $12,000 off an alt coin and reinvested into ETH. So I made a rookie mistake. Once I made the $12,000 I immediately exchanged it into Ethereum believing it to be a safe, temporary habor before I could sell it back into fiat.   I was right in the sense that the alt coin tanked. But wrong in the sense that (Ethereum also tanked).  This was last month when we were still blaming Elon for this harsh correction. I had created a $12,000 tax event for myself less than 24 hours before it dropped from $4,100. Now it's $1800.  We didn't know then what we suspect now though...  I am confident with patience that Ethereum will go back up. So I'm not too worried there. My issue is with the $12,000 tax event I have created for myself (as tax time is next month for us in Australia).  All my friends are saying, ""told you so"" and that I should have sold it when they told me to (but none of them are involved in crypto in any way). I won't lie though -- their constant holier-than-thou rhetoric is making me kind of anxious.   So I figured I'd rather bounce ideas around with a like-minded community who at least understands my predicament.   I wanted to sell and immediately buy back but washes are illegal in Australia.

How do you keep your coins safe ?**  Now that the markets are dipping, I felt this would be a good time to post about how to keep our crypto safe as we expect the veterans to pull in their friends and family into the crypto markets. This will help all the newbies navigate the security measures in cryptoverse.    * **ENABLE 2FA Authenticator everywhere. Use a separate email for crypto. Use google authenticator instead of SMS authenticator. NO QUESTIONS ASKED.** * **You take it off the exchange. You do not leave your coins on the exchange.  "" NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR COINS.""** The only times I leave coins on the exchange is when I know that I am looking to buy more coins in the next several hours. That way I avoid paying fees multiple times to withdraw from the wallet. But with coins like ADA , SOL, ONE where the fees is so low that it might even be worth getting the coins off the exchange even if you do intend to buy more coins in the next 12-24 hours.  **Alternatively, if you bought BTC or ETH/ERC-20 tokens,** you could possibly wait till your done accumulating for the session and then pay the fee at once to pull your coins out. Sure you have to pay the transaction fees but hey, that's the cost of doing business here. *  ALWAYS do regular scans on your main computer which you use to buytore your coins for malware and other threats.  *  Never publicly reveal your holdings. Never trust anyone who reveals their holdings publicly either. They are either malicious or they are lying or they are just stupid. You do not need to associate with such people in any case. *  Never use the email you use for your social accounts as your exchange's email. If you have made that mistake already, consider changing the mail or alternatively changing the account. Yes, it may sound extreme but it is worth it. *  Do not visit shady websites from your main computer. Sure, you may have anti-virus but do not risk it. Especially avoid visiting illegal websites that stream shows, sports events and porn. *  Do invest in a hardware wallet as soon as you feel it is worth it. BUT MAKE SURE that you buy directly from the manufacturer's website or from a very reputable retailer. *  I would always suggest choosing wallets which have multiple assets storage over  storing your assets in separate chrome extension wallets. Particular example comes to mind with EXODUS vs YOROI when staking ADA.  *  FACT CHECK EVERYTHING. I have lost quite a bit (not crypto but in general) by not questioning people because I was afraid I would offend them. If they are correct, they will always be delighted to prove their point.  * DOUBLE CHECK EVERYTHING. Double check whether you pasted the correct wallet address. Double check the authenticator code. Double check whether the girl you like is only into you for your crypto. Double-checking never hurts.  ***Please feel free to add anything that I may have missed.***   ***Cheers !***",535,2021-06-22 21:00:45

kyrotos,ethereum,"Thoughts on Sorare (Ethereum NFT based game)? Hi fellow redditors, I'd be very interested in hearing you guys' thoughts on **Sorare**, since I've seen that related recent posts on crypto-subs have been getting some traction.  For those who have not heard of it, here is my current understanding of it:  Sorare is essentially similar to a classical fantasy football game, only that you play with digital cards. Sorare cards are NFT's (digital collectibles) using the Ethereum blockchain. Each football player's card is tradeable inside and outside of the platform and depending on their performance in real-life games, they can score points that would increase their card value and assist it's owner to be elligeable for rewards when partaking in Sorare tournaments.  It's basically a crypto variant of FIFA'S Ultimate Team (for those familiar with it) in the sense that you can acquire player cards which can then be featured in your squad for you to compete with others.  Each card is subject to a limited supply and features various characteristics like age of the player, a serial number and a scarcity (Unique, Super Rare (10 copies) and Rare (100 copies)). There are multiple layers that define the value of a card:  1. its collectable desirability (as any other NTF) 2. its in-game value, depending on player perfomancekills and 3. a third-party game value (which I have not yet perfectly understood, but apperently there are other games where these cards can be used).  Not all global football leagues are yet covered by Sorare, since they require to enter licensing deals with league federations and teams. However more and more regions and teams have been joining over time and the platform seems to be growing quite rapidily in terms of player base, supposedly being backed by prominent football players (Griezmann to name one, can't remember the others).  I have boughtold a couple of cards now, without participating in the tournaments yet. Also, I do not have yet gotten a good grasp on how ETH volatily affects card prices and in-game rewards/prizes. But in general, the game and its mechanics have been fun and enticing so far.  **Do you guys think that this platform could have some serious potential?** I am worried for it to be a bubble of which the tokens will eventually end up having no value at all. On the other side, I could also see or other similar platforms arising or the game getting very popular. To me it seems like Sorare has the first mover advantage, since it already acquired many licenses and thus could potentialy be viable as an investment opportunity (e.g. buying undervalued players and sell these with a premium combined with collecting in-game money prizes).  **Does anyone have any experience with this specific or similar games/platforms and would be willing to share?**  Finally, I don't mean to shamelessly plug my links, but If anyone is planning on joining or trying out the game, you might aswell use my referal link: [sorare.com/r/kyrotos](https:/orare.com/r/kyrotos).

I read a few days ago about a guy who tried to stake in a particular wallet and got scammed and all ETH stolen so I‚Äôm trying to avoid that.

jxdos,ethereum,"Ethereum Transaction Summary Tool Hi guys .  I've been a long time lurker on this sub and have recently dabbled into a bit of the coding space. One think I found most challenging for mass adoption is the technical jargons, know-how and lack of newbie-friendly tools that are relatable to the current financial systems. I see a lot of great influencers on Youtube, Twitter, TikTok etc that are helping educate people, but I think what we really need is to put the tools in the hands of everyday people.   One thing I found that seems particularly daunting to new users is the way people check transactions on tools such as Etherscan. There are all these hashes and long addresses that probably doesn't mean a thing in a lot of the situations. I decided to make a tiny step to changing that by building a more visually simplified transaction viewer which aggregates & simplifies all your transactions in one place - similar to bank statements.   [Ethereum Transaction Viewer](https://excelwiz.com.au/crypto)  This hobby project is in early stages at the moment (hosted on my other business domain). If there is enough interest in this tool, I'd definitely be encouraged to build out more robust features such as registering it's own domain, expanding into multiple cryptocurrencies, more different viewing option checkboxes, and the labelling of public addresses so transactions are more easily recognizable.   As a crypto enthusiast, privacy is at the core of this project. No user data (e.g. wallet addresses) are stored on our website - they are all processed locally on your computer.   Have a try and let me know what you think. If anyone wants to help out on this project, DM me!",281,2021-06-21 05:06:13

ImSandwich,ethereum,"A simple contract for keeping track of collaterals? For a separate project that I am working on, I needed a contract that keeps track of how much ERC20/ETH is set aside by an address for another address. I wrote the following contract (github link attached), that allows a user to deposit a certain amount of ERC20/ETH into a 'collateral' position, which they can trade around to other users as if it were an NFT. They can also specify the conditions that need to be met before the position can be liquidated back into ERC20/ETH  This seemed like something general enough so I was wondering if I might be re-inventing the wheel. Is there an EIP standard for similar purposes?

Always_Question,ethereum,"The Ethereum Merge to Full POS Still Planned for End of 2021  ""If all goes as planned, the Eth1 and Eth2 merge should be completed in December this year . . .""  [https://btcmanager.com/prysmatic-labs-eth2-development/](https://btcmanager.com/prysmatic-labs-eth2-development/)  ""Proof of Stake (PoS) is coming to Ethereum, perhaps by the end of the year, definitely by early 2022.""  [https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/charting-the-path-to-proof-of-stake-ethereum/](https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/charting-the-path-to-proof-of-stake-ethereum/)  No, Vitalik did not ""delay"" the merge to POS. No, it isn't going to happen end of 2022. No, the fake article that you might have read proclaiming the supposed delay was based on a comment that was taken out of context. That said, there is a possibility that the merge is pushed into early 2022, but the plan is still for it to happen in December, 2021.  Once the full merge to POS happens, Ethereum will highly likely become deflationary (due to the combined effects of EIP 1559 and POS). This means that there will be fewer ETH in existence year after year. Some estimates suggest that the total existing supply of ETH will decrease from about 115M today to about 100M over the course of the next decade (source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQTZSb3Rc9I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQTZSb3Rc9I)). Strap up, because ETH is about to become very, very scarce.  TLDR: The ""ETH has been delayed again FUD"" that you might have heard or read recently was based on fake news.",217,2021-06-19 15:00:32

limetime99,ethereum,"Why an Ethereum Air Drop is a good idea Uniswap's Air Drop and Dogecoin were the best things to ever happen to me in crypto. Dogecoin has done quite a bit in attracting people to crypto and Uniswap has done the same for DeFi. These stories help make crypto become mainstream and build trust.  The Ethereum project has splintered into many other similar projects like Binance and Tezos and countless others. They can pull users away permanently from Ethereum. To retain and reward user loyalty and trust, an Ethereum air drop is needed. It could be a life changing thing for the many people who have built upon it and used it.  I propose an air drop in honor of the upcoming change to Ethereum 2.0 for all users of Ethereum, and more so for those who have invested heavily in Ethereum - developers based on the number and size of smart contracts they have deployed.  It would be a blessing to all users and to the hopeful but unfortunate who have tried to build on Ethereum in vain. Seeing how Ethereum is becoming deflationary, it is possible to do an air drop without diluting the value. It would certainly win the hearts and minds of the crypto community and Ethereum would become the people's hero.  Uniswap did the air drop based on wallet address alone. They did not care who you were. I think Ethereum should do the same.",240,2021-06-18 06:34:34

haochizzle,ethereum,"Announcing the ChainSafe Gaming SDK: an open-source library allowing gaming developers to bridge your gaming engine to the Web 3.0 ecosystem Hi all!  [Tim](https://twitter.com/haochizzle) from [ChainSafe](https://chainsafe.io/) here :)  We are avid open-source contributors and a blockchain protocol and infrastructure research and development firm working on a variety of ecosystems including Ethereum, Polkadot, Filecoin, Cosmos, Mina, and many more.  We recently announced the release of our open-source ChainSafe Gaming SDK.  üéâ [Announcing ChainSafe Gaming: An SDK to bridge your gaming engines to the Web 3.0 ecosystem](https://medium.com/chainsafe-systems/announcing-chainsafe-gaming-an-sdk-to-bridge-your-gaming-engines-to-the-web-3-0-ecosystem-f33aa27c7a98) üéâ  **What is the ChainSafe Gaming SDK?**  We are the first open-source blockchain gaming library of its kind to be multi-token standards (ERC-20, 721, 1155), multi-blockchains (supporting Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, xDai, Moonbeam, and Avalanche), and multi-marketplaces.  Similar to our avoidance of chain-maximalism (we deeply believe in open collaboration), we also designed our SDK to be gaming engine agnostic, with current support for the Unity engine, with Unreal and Godot soon to come.  Installing is as simple as dragging and dropping the SDK file into Unity! By using the ChainSafe Gaming SDK, gaming developers can now bridge their gaming applications into the cryptoeconomics of the Web 3.0 ecosystem (through the use of a simple login interface with Web3 wallets like Metamask, Walletconnect, and more).  **So what?**  This enables fascinating features like tying in-game micro-transactions like skins or items to NFT's, which can itself be portable over to other games and ecosystems. Or imagine use-cases where you can port over a character or player's progresstats as an NFT to a different environment. Needless to say, we are extremely excited for the future this will enable for gaming!  **What is Web 3.0?**  What is Web 3.0? In the Web 2.0 paradigm, we can read, write, and interact with all manners of websites and services on the internet. But trust remains a critically unsolved issue, as all setups requires some degree of centralization or trust. In the Web 3.0 paradigm, you can now read, write, interact, and **verify.** What does this mean? Since the blockchain itself verifies all state transitions, ""transactions"" (or messages) that get passed along within the network need not be managed by some centralized entity (like a server). The trust instead falls on an open-sourced protocol. In this sense, value can now be trustlessly transmitted across the internet via the blockchain (see [Juan Benet's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l44z35vabvA) for a much more succinct explanation than mine :P). This is what is creating the massive amounts of hype (whether deserved or undeserved) and value with blockchain ""tokens"" and ""NFTs"" you probably hear about all the time...  With the ChainSafe Gaming SDK, we just made it easier for game developers to bridge their games into the Web 3.0 economy.  **Call to action**  You can read more about the specifics of the announcement in our newest Medium blog post [here](https://medium.com/chainsafe-systems/announcing-chainsafe-gaming-an-sdk-to-bridge-your-gaming-engines-to-the-web-3-0-ecosystem-f33aa27c7a98).  We are calling on game developers to join in the conversation in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/CprJHjrWG6) by joining the #gaming channel. If you have a fascinating idea you'd like to discuss with our Head of Gaming [Leon Do](https://twitter.com/_LeonDo_), please don't hesitate to drop-in and say hi! We are looking for *committed* builders and users of the SDK.  Build with us! Check out the ChainSafe Gaming SDK Github repo [here](https://github.com/ChainSafe/web3.unity). Documentation can be found [here](https://chainsafe.github.io/game-docs/).  Finally, if you'd like some quick YouTube tutorials of how this all works, check out our playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPn3rQCo3XrM3qOkth64yWF7ctkhzb5BF).  \---  If you're curious about any of our other work, we would **love** to hear from the community. If you'd like, drop us a message here on Reddit, or on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chainsafeth).

Liberosist,ethereum,"Statelessness + state expiry I have long wanted to write a post about this, but have been patiently waiting for some concrete progress. This happened today, with Vitalik's update with a provisional roadmap with proto-EIPs: [A state expiry and statelessness roadmap - HackMD (ethereum.org)](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/verkle_and_state_expiry_proposal)  Currently, the single greatest bottleneck to scalability is state bloat. You need a 1 TB SSD to run a full node reliably with some future-proofing, and some have complained that's already too much. As the network is used, the state will only keep growing. The only recourse to manage state thus far has been to severely limit scalability.  There are two concepts that are being proposed right now to solve this long-standing challenge:  # Weak statelessness  In the weak statelessness scheme, only block proposers and full nodes will need to hold full state. All other nodes, including attesting validators, can run a stateless client and verify blocks without actually storing state. How this works: (oversimplifying) you don't need to hold the state, but just need a succinct (in the literal sense) proof, called a witness, to verify state.  This concept has been around, but the issue thus far was that even the witnesses were too large. The technology is finally ready to enable very small witnesses: Verkle trees.  Currently, Ethereum's state is stored as hexary trees. We know the beacon chain has the concept of epochs where blocks are justified and finalized. As per this proto-EIP, Ethereum will have a new time scale: Period. One period will be approximately one year. To enable statelessness, a hardfork will freeze the pre-fork hexary tree (Period 0), while all new data appended or accessed post-fork will live in the new Verkle tree (kicking off Period 1).  Whenever stateless clients are ready post the transition to Verkle trees, all regular users will be able to verify statelessly. As mentioned before, block proposers will still need to hold the full state. This will be controversial, but the important thing here is to have a culture of users verifying, and that is accomplished by weak statelessness. Gas limits can now be increased, and while block proposers will have to upgrade their systems, regular users might actually see a decreased system requirement with stateless clients despite higher scalability.  Of course, strong statelessness, where even blocks can be proposed statelessly will remain a future problem to be solved.  # State expiry  A lot of Ethereum's state hasn't been accessed in years. Yet, all nodes are burdened with this data forever. What if you could only hold the relevant, recently accessed data, while archive (again, literally) lapsed data? Proposals around state rent, state expiry and regenesis have suggested similar schemes, but now we have a concrete proto-EIP. For the longest time, state expiry and statelessness were considered competing solutions to the same problem, but amazingly, now they are both being implemented together!  Each period, state from two periods (\~years) ago is frozen and archived. In state expiry, full nodes and block proposers will only need to store state from two periods - the current and the previous. Users looking to verify transactions will continue to verify statelessly.  The state expiry hard fork happens at the beginning of Period 1, or roughly 1 year after moving to Verkle trees and enabling weak stateleness. Here, the pre-statelessness Period 0 hex tree will be replace with a Verkle tree. I'd expect from Period 3, the Period 1 state will expire, and so on.  Overall, both combined, state management will be effectively be solved, and we can start increasing gas limits without worrying about long-term state bloat. However, expect this increase to be moderate, around 3x is suggested by Vitalik. I believe this to be a very conservative estimate, particularly with SSDs continuing to become more affordable. Now, we have mainstream $400-$500 game consoles (well, when they're available) shipping with extremely fast 1 TB NVMe SSDs. By the time statelessness + state expiry ship, I fully expect budget laptops to feature 1 TB and above SSDs. Further, clients like Erigon are putting in a lot of work to optimize this. So, I'd optimistically expect a 5x-10x increase in scalability instead while still reducing system requirements compared to now, though of course. Of course, as SSDs becomes more affordable over time, we can scale linearly now that we have predictable state management.  Users can revive expired data by paying gas for it. What about expired state? There can obviously be archive nodes which can continue to contain the full state. This will almost certainly be very, very expensive, so we'll need some sort of infrastructure for expired state. I believe Solana is exploring using Arweave for similar state rent schemes, though I wasn't able to find any details. IPFS, BitTorrent, Filecoin and others are all options.  # Rollups and sharding  State management is crucial for rollups, because they are designed around having immense state bloat. Because the entire rollup state can be reconstructed from L1, they can be even more innovative and flexible with how they approach this. Things like regenesis are easily done. Rollups can be the perfect way to battle-test these new schemes being proposed. I'd expect Optimistic Ethereum, for example, to transition to Verkle trees and state expiry well before Ethereum mainnet does with much shorter periods given it already has an archival mechanism on L1. Of course, rollups will benefit directly from whatever scalability upgrades state management brings to L1 as well.  Statelessness + state expiry will directly multiply sharding execution, as each shard will also feature these scalability improvements. Though, given the scalability improvements statelessness + state expiry bring to the single execution chain, and the scalability rollups + data sharding offer, would we even need executable shards in the foreseeable future? Seems doubtful to me. I wasn't able to find any concrete information on how the current proposals will directly affect data shards, but I'd expect many of these concepts to be adapted for it in the future.  # Concluding  Proof-of-stake will solve sustainability. Rollups + data sharding will solve scalability. State size management was the last remaining challenge, and it's being met head on with some real, concrete proposals now. One could argue that privacy and VM innovations are a further pending challenge: but I'd expect rollups to better better address these. Indeed, we're seeing this with Aztec being privacy-focused, while zkSync 2.0 introduces LLVM and StarkWare has built a quantum-resistant StarkNet OS. Of course, learnings from these rollups can be adopted on L1 if desired.",1083,2021-06-17 08:29:59

Developers can wait forever on Vitalik to fulfill his promises, or they can deploy their smart contract on a network that offers similar, same or even better (no transaction fees, high throughput etc) .... today. Even if the developers would rather stay on Ethereum, I imagine some Tech Lead or CEO type could easily force entire teams to make the switch.

To aid in mass adoption of crypto in general, when doing odd jobs or anything where you‚Äôd ordinarily transact in cash under 100 dollars, let‚Äôs force whoever is paying to pay us in crypto, whichever it may be.   Say a buddy asks for a ride and is willing to pay 10-20 dollars. Instead of accepting cash, agree to the deal only if they pay in crypto.   If they don‚Äôt know how, kindly assist them with setting up an account and allowing you to watch every step of the way, as well as confirming the numbers with them before you send to your wallet from theirs.   1. Don‚Äôt be a scumbag and send yourself 100 bucks in crypto while telling them it‚Äôs only 10 or 20 or whatever.  2. Show them how the fees work as well. If you agreed to say 25 dollar payment, use enough out of the 25 to cover the gas fees for them the first time, while explaining how they work and letting them know they‚Äôll have to pay them per transaction.    If you‚Äôre a kid in crypto, you‚Äôre probably more tech savvy than most adults. You can probably figure out how to download the necessary things to hold crypto.   1. Pay each other in crypto for small amounts of cash. Say under 10 bucks if you‚Äôre a kid. Since you will need that cash in the short term just use small amounts.  2.

Edit: I understand that Metamask is an 'Ethereum explorer' so it would only NEED to be compatible with Ethereum blockchain, but I'm wondering what technology it is exactly that enables other wallets to be multi-blockchain-compatible.  Edit 2: Or am I visualising it all wrong (I came across the statement that wallets don't actually HODL any crypto -- they technically are just keys) and actually a wallet just acts a key that various different blockchains can accept?  Edit 3: It seems like e.g. Trust is actually an account that compiles a bunch of different wallet addresses and keys for different blockchains, so it's actually an aggregated wallet, not a single address that's compatible with a bunch of blockchains...

eneskaraboga,ethereum,"A Business Idea: Trading Pools Automated with Smart Contracts Yo guys, I'm just a trader with a very low coding skills. If you think I don't know what I am talking about, please tell me so. Also, please show me similar successful websites (not shady bs $5 bots). I know this is not the first time someone thinks an idea like that, so please don't bash me :)  \--  I've been trading crypto for some time now. I was asked, like most of us, for help trading. I helped some people learn, I traded for friends and family, etc. I was thinking what if I offered this as a service.  The idea goes like this: I have a pool in a contract. People can connect their wallets, and their funds are locked for a period of time. In the meantime, I trade using Uniswap. I get some percentage out of their profits automatically, the rest is delivered to their wallets. They can get their all money after a lockup period or whenever they want.  It can also be like a market place. The beauty of this would be all trades are open. They can see past data, trades, and results. So, trading pool owner won't be able to fake results as everything is in the blockchain.  Something like this can bring successful traders and investors together, like hedge funds. Yet, the hedge funds only work with big clients and they are not available to public. Successful traders cannot trade with other people's money, because, regulations and shit. So, this should solve a lot of problems.  What do you guys think?     One example (not affiliated)- - [https://zignaly.com/](https://zignaly.com/)",276,2021-06-15 20:55:55

Clinamenic,ethereum,"Building an ecosystem of think-tank DAOs on Ethereum I've been wondering about the prospects, operationally and financially, of establishing a research unit as a DAO, one whose procurement of intellectual content may be monetizable via native currency, be it ETH or some more specialized one built upon Ethereum.  Are there any examples of think tanks, schools, or other research-based institutions launched as DAOs? Any legacy institutions that have launched some kind of auxiliary DAO?  Provided such an infrastructure is economically feasible, there could be good prospects for advancing the velocity of innovation across sectors, borders, and disciplines. As it is currently, there are mountains of open-source technical research, but I fear that the existing pathways of facilitating and delivering this research do not do it justice. I could be wrong, though.  Imagine the prospects of a constellation of decentralized research units, with considerably lower overhead than physically-embodied centers of research, each with as sharp a focus as it deems worthwhile. Researchers could be, in effect, traveling specialists without needing to leave their computer, so long as their academic acumen is translatable to blockchain-compatible terms. A sort of academic gig economy, but without the centralized likes of Uber, etc.  Intellectual property (PDFs?) as NFTs? Decentralized peer review (edit: peer-to-peer review)? Smart contracts that govern credentials instead of human academic incumbents? Niche micro-MOOCs?  In a way we already see the seeds of this with the ecosystem of independent scholars using podcasts at their platforms. Just seems like a system that could benefit, one way or the other, from blockchain technology.  Also, my first thought was Ethereum, but it could be an interchain ecosystem, as far as I can tell.",277,2021-06-15 18:43:57

thatgloomyguy,ethereum,"Trustless referral network based on ERC-20 token based dApp I am not entirely sure whether this is the correct forum to discuss a new idea based on an ERC-20 token. Also, I am not sure whether this use case is already considered and proven wrong. If so, letting me know will save a lot of valuable hours.   My idea is to create a D-App, which is a trustless referral platform and curated marketplace to sell products from Amazon or any other marketplace which allows referral earnings. Anonymous users can connect their wallets to the platform and create collections based on their tastes. Whenever they create a collection, they will be awarded a certain amount for tokens. The token that users will get is a custom token that is generated specifically for this network. These users will be known as collectors.  Now normal users also can join the network and browse through collections. The collectors can either make their collections free or they can add a fee so that the normal users need to pay this fee in order to visit the collection. This way the token is being circulated. The referral links for each of the products will take the users to the corresponding market place and if they made a purchase, the commission will be processed. 75% of the commission will be awarded to users who make the purchase and 25% will go to the corresponding collector. This commission is also in terms of the token that is used in the network and based on the current dollar value of the token,   I know this is very basic, but this is the idea. I am just testing whether this will work and it will be helpful if you let me know what you think about this? I am a programmer and web developer myself, so I can write smart contracts and deploy it to the network. If someone wanna join me, you are very much welcome.",327,2021-06-15 06:25:48

I also see that the time that the ETH could be tied up and rewards of staking ETH for 2.0 aren‚Äôt particularly incentivising compared to some other staking rewards offered by other tokens, so I‚Äôm wondering what the chances are of there being a hard fork?",106,2021-06-15 06:24:52

VZ_Twosix,ethereum,"QUESTION: If Metamask confirms a contract interaction, but the transaction remains unsuccessful due to network congestion, could the nonce remain neglected indefinitely? Hi all. Please bear with the length of this post - I'm a noob and I'm trying to make sense of the nuance. Here's the context:  I initiated an ERC-20 token swap through Matcha (via Uniswap, by way of a Metamask wallet) about 3 hours ago - after paying the gas fee, Matcha declared a successful trade and the contract interaction was submitted.  According to Metamask, the smart contract interaction was confirmed...but, because the transaction remains pending, the token exchange has yet to occur.  Between the time I initiated the transaction and the nonce made its way into the queue, the network became very congested. The gas fee I paid was about 1/3rd of what it would have been, should the transaction have been initiated a short time later.  This is what leads into my question - If a contract interaction is confirmed, but the transaction remains unsuccessful due to network congestion, could the nonce remain neglected indefinitely?  In other words - If it is impossible to pay the gas ""speed up"" fee, thus incentivising solving of the nonce, is the successful completion of the transaction (and the duration thereof) at risk of falling into oblivion?  At the very least, I assume transaction confirmation will (at the earliest) occur once the level of network traffic declines to where it was pre-initiation...but could it, theoretically, remain unconfirmed for ***days*** if sustained congestion levels declares it a low priority?",259,2021-06-14 16:33:13

melheor,ethereum,"Trying to get funds to Matic without any Ethereum in my wallet I know this is a noob mistake, but it's an especially expensive one on Ethereum. I purchased some Matic on Binance and trying to transfer it to Matic network. I should've listened to the guy who suggested going through BSC but selling and rebuying Matic again seemed like more work initially (although in hindsight would have been probably easier). So I paid \~$20 to Binance to move my Matic to ERC20, figuring it would be a one-time fee that I would quickly recoup with some yield farming on Matic. I knew the bridge would cost me another $10 or so but didn't realize I could only pay that fee in Ethereum, which I don't have.  Now I'm in a position where I can't even buy Ethereum with my ERC20 Matic because swap fees are in Ethereum as well (I need \~$1.7 to approve Matic/Eth swap, and then I figure another couple bucks to trade it). Moving more money to Binance to buy some Ethereum to then send it to my wallet again would probably cost me another $50 in fees or so. What are my options to get the $5-10 in Eth I need without paying another $50 to get it to my wallet? I do have about $100 on Matic network if it's possible to transfer any of that to Ethereum for cheaper?",236,2021-06-13 16:38:35

I am curious if exchanges being basically centralized banks in a decentralized economy may be using trading pairs and their exchange coins to steal money.

One only needs to look at Bitcoin to see it is at the point of being traded with bots to create volume to pamp up the price with little purchases after every sell. Then I found this article below and tether was just kicked out of NY. These fraudsters seem like they are ruining crypto. If this is true can the projects do anything about phony coins on their blockchain from purchasing the blockchain? Think about it, tether is printed on Ethereum and then used to buy Ethereum but there is not a dollar behind the stable coin. In fact they printed so much tether after the Bitcoin crash to buy Bitcoin it was bizarre. Tethers are never burned like other stable coins it seems, they just keep printing more never needing to burn them? They basically stole Ethers with counterfeit dollars printed on its own network using a central bank and exchanges.

In his own words ""a schizo""  What this ""schizo"" has to do with ethereum?  **Introduction to ""aletheo""**  \- Aletheo is a project that's completely based on the concept of freedom and expansion of both anti censorship and multi polar capitalism.

In his own words in fact, if this becomes big enough it **can even solve global poverty**.  In simpler terms the project requires 2 things:  Founders: People who will influence the world and they will have more than just money, but power. But that power and money won't have the capability to interrupt, control, or centralize anything, they will just benefit, get benefitted, provide, and get provided.   Users will be able to work unconditionally, and get paid unconditionally, with no medium, no middleman, from home. And all that just by using.    And about **ETHEREUM**  Ethereum was created for aletheo, a censorship resistant blockchain with programmable transactions, aletheo is the apex of power as of now today translated into code. Aletheo can make ethereum unbannable, immortal, and indestructible.    The library he used and the beginning of everything was:   [GitHub - SamPorter1984/EIPs: The Ethereum Improvement Proposal repository](https://github.com/SamPorter1984/EIPs)   The Ethereum Improvement Proposal repository     Join the founding event: [https://aletheo.net/](https://aletheo.net/)  The success of this project is inevitable, because of constant shilling. even if founding event literally gains only 40 ether, it's still enough for a big start.

tatertotsume,ethereum,"EIL5: How Are Dapps Any More De-Centralized Than The Platforms We Currently Use?  I was browsing r/ethereum this morning, and I saw a cool post where a student in Australia was able to pull up his/her test scores on a blockchain powered by Ethereum. This is really, really cool -- I thought: ‚ÄúWow! This is only the beginning for real world Ethereum use cases.‚Äù   I‚Äôm having some trouble understanding how this example concretely looks like, which is why I wanted to solicit help from this community, to hopefully understand the concept of Ethereum a little bit better :)   Forgive me if I butcher this explanation; I‚Äôm new to this whole blockchain stuff and I‚Äôm outlining this in the best way that I can best understand it:  \-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Okay, so in the Australian test score example, I‚Äôd imagine there is some sort of decentralized application (dApp) the Australian school system (A.S.S. for short) uses to post student test scores. To keep random hackers (or trolls) from posting false test scores on this blockchain and trolling up the entire grade posting, I‚Äôd imagine the A.S.S. needs some sort of gate-keeping code to say: ‚Äúonly those who verifiably work in the A.S.S. can publicly post blockchains on this dApp‚Äù. This, most likely, requires some sort of login/password system; only those with A.S.S. -verified accounts can make postings/edits.   Though, this got me thinking: yes, we are keeping student grade data on a decentralized blockchain, but at the end of the day, access is still centralized under the dApp. I understand the security of keeping something on the Ethereum Blockchain itself, but couldn‚Äôt a hacker instead steal the A.S.S. login credentials on the dApp, and make all sorts of fake grade postings?   I understand that it is more secure to keep (student) data on a blockchain, because once posted on the blockchain, it can never get erased/wiped off the blockchain. However, when it comes to security of ‚ÄúWho is making new posts on the blockchain‚Äù, I‚Äôm having trouble understanding how centralizing access on a dApp is any more secure than centralizing (student) data across a school-shared (Microsoft?) drive.   \----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Thanks in advance for reading this post! I want to believe in the long-term adoption of Ethereum, but I‚Äôm having trouble getting comfortable around this idea of keeping access/login keys on centralized platforms. Any and all help, feedback on this concern is appreciated, fellow Redditors!",399,2021-06-12 17:14:14

Task manager occasionally shows Firefox child processors maxing out single-cores, and force quitting those will crash the respective tab(s), cool down the laptop, and restore performance, but it won't often be long before I notice that I'm back to having hot thighs.  I've added Auto Tab Discard to try and unload tabs I'm not using, but it seems that if I'm working in any dapps, even if the others are discarded/asleep, it'll start warming up again.  I can't find out if its Firefox, Metamask, or some other issue, let alone how to resolve it.  I was thinking of trying Brave browser, but I wanted to see if this was a familiar issue to anyone before migrating everything over to a new browser where the same issues might exist.  Thank you for any information anyone may have.",229,2021-06-12 05:56:30

PeacockMamba,ethereum,"Elon Musk, Markets and Money üí∞ **Elon Musk, Market and Money**     Elon Musk has always evoked public interest (as billionaire genius types tend to do). The ongoing story this year, for better or worse, has been in the crypto space, where people have [taken](https://twitter.com/elonmusktatus/1284291528328790016) their cues from his [views.](https://twitter.com/elonmusktatus/1392602041025843203?lang=en)  Earlier this year Tesla caused waves when they published their [balance sheet](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm) and announced to the world that they had 1.5 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin (BTC) listed as an asset. More recently, Musk's comments have prompted crypto sales that have seen the price of Bitcoin tumble from above $60,000 into the $30,000-$40,000 range. Overall, the collective crypto market cap fell by just over a trillion dollars over May.  # Musk and Market  So why does Elon seem to have this power to influence the world of crypto?  First, let's talk about **money** in **all its forms: fiat and crypto**. Arguably, **money is a type of social power storage, like a battery**. We use it to temporarily **store our power to engage others** (on our projects and for our whims), and when we pay for a good or a service, we draw on that power. In a similar vein to electricity, it is a consumable resource and is transferred as it is used.  After that, the question is which money (or battery) to use? History shows that an implicit contract exists between society and the choice of money system: At various points in world history, including Weimar, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe, nation state-backed fiat systems have broken down because economic agents broke this contract.  Elon Musk, in this context, has a good amount of stored social power (money). This social power he harnesses can move markets, as we see below.  # Market and Money  This points to **monetary systems as a type of database that accounts for social power**, but only if **we agree to use that database**. In this vein, a token system is a medium for value storage (and possibly utility storage) for a network of users that choose to adopt that system using a social contract. If the database is corrupt, why would you use it?  Less dramatic than the collapse of a national currency is the assignment of social power to crypto assets. Over a decade, a social contract has developed between crypto and a user network, along with bridges between crypto tokens and fiat tokens as valid stores of value. Remember the guy who paid 10,000BTC for two pizzas in 2010? That was the start of a social contract that turned BTC into a form of social power storage.  The beauty of crypto is that we are now moving from a type of general-purpose money backed by states to a system of fit-for-purpose tokens that do weird and wonderful things. However, the network effects on cryptocurrencies are more pronounced and subject to social whimsy.  # Musk and Money  Elon‚Äôs whims can either **endorse the implicit contract** between BTC and other forms of **storing social power** (Dogecoin) or they can repudiate this contract. Earlier this year, the decision to add BTC to the balance sheets of Tesla acted as an **endorsement of value**. And so, on cue, people bought more BTC.  Now Elon is tweeting the other way, and Tesla has decided not to accept BTC as a form of payment for its vehicles. The good news is that while toddlers stumble more than adults, eventually, we all learn to walk.  # Bitcoin, the new money  The difference between crypto and fiat is simple. We are privatising money. Thus, the risk to governments everywhere is that society decouples (at least partially) from the default, nation-state fiat store of value because there are valid alternatives. Is it good or bad? You decide.",623,2021-06-11 23:57:39
